**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant difference between the week's high and low.  The CM Annual Volatility of 36.11% further confirms this.  The risk-reward profile is currently unfavorable due to the high volatility and inconsistent financial performance.


**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Established brand in the consumer durables sector.
* Consistent dividend payouts (historically).


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and significant price swings.
* Inconsistent and declining financial performance (losses in recent quarters).
* Low market depth, indicating low liquidity.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The current price drop and high volatility suggest a high risk of further losses in the short term.  The low market depth adds to the risk.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  The medium-term outlook depends on improvement in financial performance and a reduction in volatility.  Without a clear indication of improvement, buying is not recommended.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  While the company has a strong brand, the current financial performance and high volatility pose significant long-term risks.  Further investigation into the reasons for the losses is needed before considering a long-term investment.
