| Quarter      | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Shares held by Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| 30-Sep-2023  | 75.00                        | 25.00      | 0.00                           | 100.00    |

A significant drop in promoter holding from 75% to 51% between December 2023 and March 2024 is noteworthy and requires further investigation to understand the reasons behind this change.


**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant difference between the week's high and low prices. The high annualized volatility (35.92%) further confirms this.  The low market depth adds to the risk, suggesting that large trades could significantly impact the price.  The risk-reward profile appears unfavorable given the high volatility and inconsistent financial performance.


**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Established brand presence in the Indian market.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and low market depth.
* Inconsistent financial performance with fluctuating profit after tax and EPS.
* Significant decrease in promoter holding.
* Limited information on key financial ratios hinders a comprehensive assessment.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and recent price decline make a short-term investment risky.
* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock).**  Further investigation into the reasons for the promoter shareholding decrease is crucial.  Monitor financial performance closely.
* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  The inconsistent financial performance and high volatility outweigh the advantages of long-term investment.

**Stock Score (out of 10): 5.5**

* Market performance: 3/10 (High volatility, negative recent performance)
