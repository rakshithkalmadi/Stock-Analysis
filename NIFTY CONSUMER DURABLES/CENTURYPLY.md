Promoter holding has slightly decreased over the past year, while public holding has correspondingly increased. This is a relatively minor shift and doesn't indicate a significant change in control.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant week-high and week-low prices.  The CM Annual Volatility of 37.06% further confirms this.  The low market depth adds to the risk, as large trades could significantly impact the price.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards risk due to the volatility and low liquidity.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Strong promoter holding (although slightly decreased recently).
* Established market position in the consumer durables sector.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and price swings.
* Low market depth, leading to liquidity concerns.
* Inconsistent profitability in recent quarters.
* Several announcements regarding loss/duplicate share certificates.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and low liquidity make short-term trading risky.  The recent price decline and low market depth increase the risk of further losses.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock).**  The medium-term outlook depends on the company's ability to improve its profitability and address the administrative issues highlighted in the announcements.  Further analysis of the full financial statements is crucial.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold (if you have stock).**  The long-term prospects depend on the company's ability to maintain its market share and adapt to changing industry dynamics.  However, the current volatility and inconsistent financial performance warrant caution.
