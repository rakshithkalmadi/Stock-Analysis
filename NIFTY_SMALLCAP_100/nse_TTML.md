**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* The data shows a relatively high week-to-week price range (₹65.05 to ₹111.40), indicating significant volatility.

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

* **Consistent Net Losses:** The company has consistently reported significant net losses over the past five quarters, indicating poor financial health.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided financial data and market indicators, TTML presents a high-risk investment with no clear signs of near-term improvement.  The consistent losses and high volatility make it unsuitable for most investors.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the persistent losses would be necessary before considering any investment.
