**3. Recent Announcements:**

Several announcements relate to changes in directors, cessation of employment, trading windows, and credit ratings.  These are typical corporate actions and don't provide strong buy/sell signals on their own.


**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While the financial performance shows a positive trend in income, profit, and EPS, the high volatility and lack of recent dividend announcements temper enthusiasm.  The consistent high promoter holding is a positive sign of management stability.  However, the relatively high volatility and the absence of compelling positive corporate actions suggest a "hold" strategy is prudent until further information becomes available.  More detailed analysis of the financial statements (beyond the summarized data provided) would be necessary to make a more definitive recommendation.  The current price movement is not significant enough to trigger a buy or sell decision.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data provided, Central Bank of India presents a mixed picture.  Positive financial trends are offset by high volatility and a lack of recent dividend payouts.  A "hold" recommendation is advised pending further analysis and information.
