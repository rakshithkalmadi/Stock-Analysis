**4. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

While the consistent dividend payouts are positive, the significant price drop, high volatility, and the lack of access to financial performance data raise serious concerns.  The absence of promoter holdings is also a major red flag, suggesting a lack of internal confidence in the company's future prospects.  Further investigation into the financial health of the company is crucial before considering any investment.  The high volatility alone makes this a risky investment at this time.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data, the current situation for MCX presents a high-risk profile.  The lack of financial data prevents a more thorough analysis, but the existing indicators suggest caution is warranted.  More information is needed before a buy recommendation can be considered.
