**3. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the recommendation is **Don't Buy**.

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Promoter Holding:** The consistently low promoter holding (3.99%) raises significant concerns about management commitment and long-term vision.  This is a major red flag.
* **Inconsistent Financial Performance:**  The fluctuating profitability and lack of a clear upward trend in revenue and EPS indicate significant financial instability.
* **High Volatility:** The high daily and annual volatility suggests substantial risk.
* **Incomplete Data:** The lack of complete market depth data limits the analysis.

**Conclusion:**

While the recent dividend announcements are positive, the low promoter holding, inconsistent financial performance, and high volatility outweigh these positives.  The limited data on market depth prevents a more definitive assessment, but the existing information strongly suggests that ZEEL is a high-risk investment with uncertain prospects.  Further investigation is recommended before considering any investment.
