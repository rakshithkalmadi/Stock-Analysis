**Conclusion:**

RAILTEL shows signs of a healthy business with a strong promoter base and consistent dividend payments. However, the high volatility presents a risk.  Given the recent price drop and the inherent volatility, a "Hold" recommendation is prudent until further data clarifies the current market trend and reduces the risk profile.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop would be beneficial before considering a buy decision.
