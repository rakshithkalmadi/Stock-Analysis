More data and a clearer trend in financial performance are needed before recommending a buy.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, CHENNPETRO presents a mixed picture.  The high dividend payout is attractive, but the volatile financial performance and high volatility make it a risky investment at this time. A "hold" recommendation is prudent until further information clarifies the company's financial trajectory.  Further analysis of the detailed financial results and news announcements may provide a more definitive outlook.
