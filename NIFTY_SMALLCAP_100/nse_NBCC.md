**Hold.**

While the company shows consistent profitability and a stable promoter holding, the recent price drop, high volatility, and lack of detailed information regarding recent announcements raise concerns.  The positive aspects (dividends, bonus issue, stable promoter holding) are counterbalanced by the negative aspects (price decline, high volatility, limited announcement details).  More information is needed before a "Buy" recommendation can be made.  Further investigation into the "Updates" announcements is crucial for a more informed decision.  The high volatility suggests that the stock price is susceptible to significant fluctuations, making it a riskier investment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, NBCC (India) Limited presents a mixed picture.  While the fundamentals appear reasonably sound, the recent price movement and high volatility warrant a cautious approach.  A "Hold" recommendation is advised until further information clarifies the recent market activity and announcements.
