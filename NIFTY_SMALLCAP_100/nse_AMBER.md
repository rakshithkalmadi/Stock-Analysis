**Don't Buy.**

The financial performance of AMBER shows significant volatility and inconsistency. While there have been periods of profitability, the recent quarters (Q1 and Q4 FY24) show losses, resulting in negative EPS.  The declining promoter holding, coupled with high volatility and risk metrics, raises concerns.  While the recent announcements suggest expansion plans, the lack of consistent profitability makes it risky to invest at this time.  Further observation and analysis of future financial results are recommended before considering a purchase.


**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, AMBER presents a high-risk investment. The inconsistent financial performance, declining promoter holding, and high volatility outweigh the potential benefits of recent announcements and corporate actions.  A "Don't Buy" recommendation is given until more positive financial trends are observed.
