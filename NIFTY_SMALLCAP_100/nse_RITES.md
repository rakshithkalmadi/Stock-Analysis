**3. Recent Announcements:**

Several announcements related to "Bagging/Receiving of orders/contracts" and changes in management/personnel.  These are positive indicators of ongoing business activity.


**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While RITES shows consistent profitability and a strong promoter holding, the recent price drop and high volatility raise concerns.  The positive announcements regarding new contracts and consistent dividend payouts are encouraging. However, given the current market price movement and high volatility, a "Hold" recommendation is more prudent until further price stabilization and clearer market trends emerge.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop is warranted before considering a "Buy" decision.


**5. Conclusion:**

RITES demonstrates a history of positive financial performance and strong promoter support.  However, the recent price decline and high volatility suggest caution.  A "Hold" strategy allows investors to monitor the situation and reassess the investment opportunity once more information is available and market stability is observed.
