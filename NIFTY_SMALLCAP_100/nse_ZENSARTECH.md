**3. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While Zensar Technologies has a history of dividend payments and generally stable financial performance, the recent price decline and moderate to high volatility warrant a cautious approach.  The slight decrease in promoter holding is not a significant concern based on the provided data.  Further observation is recommended before considering a buy.  More detailed analysis of the financial statements and a deeper understanding of the recent announcements would be beneficial for a more informed decision.  The current data does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend a "Buy" with high confidence.


**Conclusion:**

Based solely on the provided data, Zensar Technologies appears to be a moderately risky investment with a history of profitability and dividend payouts. However, the recent price drop and volatility suggest a "Hold" recommendation until further information clarifies the market's current assessment of the company's prospects.  Additional factors not included in this data set could influence the investment decision.
