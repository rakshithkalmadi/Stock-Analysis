**3. Final Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided data:

**Verdict: Hold**

**Reasoning:**

While the financial performance shows a generally positive trend with increasing income and profit after tax over the last year, the recent quarter shows a dip in EPS and a significant drop in the share price.  The high volatility and risk associated with the stock, as indicated by the wide range of week high and low prices and volatility metrics, are significant concerns.  The relatively stable promoter holding is a positive sign.  The consistent dividend payouts are also positive.  However, given the recent price drop and high volatility, a "Hold" recommendation is more prudent than a "Buy" at this time.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and a more comprehensive risk assessment would be necessary before considering a "Buy" recommendation.

**Conclusion:**

Blue Star Limited shows some positive financial indicators, but the recent price drop and high volatility warrant a cautious approach.  More information is needed to make a confident "Buy" or "Sell" decision.  A "Hold" strategy allows for further observation and analysis before making a more decisive investment choice.
