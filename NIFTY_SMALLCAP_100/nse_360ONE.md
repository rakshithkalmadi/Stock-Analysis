**2.1 Current Price Analysis:**

The current price is slightly below the previous close and significantly below the week high.  The pre-open activity suggests limited trading interest.

**2.2 Financial Performance:**

Financial performance shows significant volatility in profitability and EPS over the last five quarters.  While Q1 2024 showed strong EPS, subsequent quarters have seen a decline.

**2.3 Shareholding Analysis:**

The decline in promoter holdings is a significant negative indicator, suggesting potential loss of confidence in the company's future prospects.
