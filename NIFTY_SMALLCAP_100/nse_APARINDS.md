**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While Apar Industries Limited shows consistent profitability and a strong promoter holding, the high volatility and relatively high PE ratio (46.85) warrant caution.  The recent increase in dividend is positive, but the overall picture suggests a period of observation is prudent before considering a buy.  Further investigation into the drivers of volatility and a deeper dive into the financial statements are recommended before making a definitive investment decision.  The consistent profitability and high dividend payout are positive indicators, but the high volatility and PE ratio suggest a need for further analysis before a buy recommendation can be made with high confidence.


**5. Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, Apar Industries Limited presents a mixed picture.  Positive aspects include consistent profitability, a high dividend payout, and stable promoter holding. However, high volatility and a high PE ratio raise concerns.  A "Hold" recommendation is given, pending further investigation and a more comprehensive risk assessment.
