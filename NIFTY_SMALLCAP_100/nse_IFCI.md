**2.1 Current Price Analysis:**

The current price (₹61.00) is significantly lower than the week high (₹91.40) and higher than the week low (₹26.45).  The pre-open activity suggested a slightly higher opening price, but the actual opening price was lower.  The closing price is below the previous close.

**2.2 Financial Performance:**

The financial performance shows significant volatility in profitability and EPS over the last five quarters.  While there were periods of profit, there are also substantial losses.

**2.3 Shareholding Analysis:**

Promoter shareholding increased slightly, indicating some confidence from the company's leadership.

**2.4 Corporate Action Summary:**

Only AGMs are noted; no dividends or other significant corporate actions are evident in the provided data.

**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, with a daily volatility of 3.95% and an annual volatility of 75.46%. This indicates a higher risk investment.

**3. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

While the increase in promoter holdings suggests some internal confidence, the highly volatile nature of the stock, coupled with inconsistent and largely negative financial performance over the last five quarters (showing significant losses in three out of five quarters), makes this a high-risk investment with limited upside potential based solely on the provided data.  The negative profit after tax in the last two quarters is particularly concerning.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the fluctuating financial performance is needed before considering any investment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, IFCI Limited presents a high-risk profile due to its volatile nature and inconsistent financial performance.  The recent decline in price further strengthens the "Don't Buy" recommendation.  More detailed analysis and understanding of the underlying reasons for the financial fluctuations are crucial before considering this stock.
