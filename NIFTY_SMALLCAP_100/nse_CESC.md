**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While the company shows consistent promoter holding and has a history of paying dividends, the recent price drop and moderate to high volatility raise concerns.  The financial performance is relatively stable, but doesn't show strong growth.  Further analysis and monitoring are recommended before considering a buy decision.  The current data does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend a sell.


**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, CESC Limited presents a mixed picture.  The stable promoter holding and dividend payments are positive indicators, but the recent price decline and volatility warrant a cautious approach.  More information, particularly regarding future growth prospects, is needed to make a more definitive investment recommendation.
