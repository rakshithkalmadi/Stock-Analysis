**3. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

The company has consistently reported losses over the past five quarters, indicating significant financial distress. While promoter holding remains stable, the lack of profitability and high volatility present substantial risk.  The absence of positive indicators, such as increasing revenue or improving profitability, makes a "buy" recommendation impossible to justify based solely on the provided data.  Further investigation into the reasons for the consistent losses is necessary before considering any investment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the financial performance and high volatility, NSLNISP presents a high-risk investment with no clear signs of improvement.  The consistent losses and lack of positive corporate actions strongly suggest avoiding this stock until further positive developments are observed.
