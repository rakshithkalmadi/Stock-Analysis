**2. Analysis**

**2.1 Current Price Analysis:**

The current price (818) is significantly lower than the week high (1790.75) indicating a recent downward trend.  The pre-open activity shows a slight upward pressure, but the final price was lower than the previous close.

**2.2 Financial Performance Analysis:**

While the income has shown a general upward trend, the profit after tax and EPS have fluctuated.  The most recent quarter shows a lower EPS compared to the previous quarters.  This needs further investigation to determine the cause.

**2.3 Shareholding Analysis:**

The consistent, albeit small, decrease in promoter holding is a negative signal, suggesting potential lack of confidence from the promoters.

**2.4 Corporate Action Analysis:**

The dividend announcement is positive, but it's a single data point and doesn't provide a complete picture.

**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

The daily and annual volatility metrics (2.22% and 42.41% respectively) suggest moderate to high risk.  The high week high compared to the current price also indicates significant volatility.

**3. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

* The significant drop in price from the week high and the negative change from the previous close indicate a bearish trend.
* The declining promoter holding, although small, raises concerns.
* While the company shows some growth in income, the recent dip in EPS and the high volatility present significant risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the fluctuating profitability is needed before considering a buy.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, CREDITACCESS GRAMEEN LIMITED presents a high-risk investment at the current price.  The declining promoter holding and recent price drop outweigh the positive aspects of the dividend announcement and past financial performance.  More information is needed to assess the long-term prospects of the company.  A thorough review of the financial statements and an understanding of the reasons behind the recent price drop and fluctuating profitability are crucial before making any investment decision.
