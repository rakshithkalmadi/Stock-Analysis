**4. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

The significant decrease in promoter holdings (from 31.30% to 21.59% in one year) raises serious concerns about the company's future prospects and management confidence. While financial performance shows positive growth, the substantial drop in promoter shareholding outweighs this positive trend.  The high annual volatility further adds to the risk.  More investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the decrease in promoter holdings before considering any investment.


**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, the substantial reduction in promoter shareholding presents a significant red flag.  Although the financial performance shows improvement, the risk associated with the high volatility and the lack of transparency regarding the promoter shareholding reduction make this stock a high-risk investment at this time.  Further investigation is strongly recommended before considering a purchase.
