**5. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:** While the financial performance shows some positive aspects (positive profits and dividends), the significant drop in promoter holdings (-2.01%) raises serious concerns.  This could indicate a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects from those closest to its operations.  Coupled with the extremely high annualized volatility (65.34%), the risk outweighs the potential reward.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decrease in promoter holdings is crucial before considering any investment.

**Conclusion:** Based on the available data, the significant decrease in promoter holdings and the high volatility present considerable risk.  Until further information clarifies the reasons behind the promoter share reduction, a "Don't Buy" recommendation is warranted.
