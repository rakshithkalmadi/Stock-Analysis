Promoter holding remains consistently at 0.00%, with public holding dominating.  This data is limited and doesn't show recent trends.  More recent data is crucial for a proper analysis.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices (₹7,048.6 and ₹2,917.85 respectively). The CM Daily Volatility (2.48%) and CM Annual Volatility (47.38%) further confirm this.  The low market depth adds to the risk, making it difficult to execute large trades without significantly impacting the price.  The risk-reward profile is currently unfavorable due to high volatility and low liquidity.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* **Dividend History:** MCX has a history of paying dividends, offering potential income for long-term investors.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* **High Volatility:** The stock is highly volatile, posing significant risk to short-term and medium-term investors.
* **Low Liquidity:** Low market depth makes it difficult to buy or sell large quantities without impacting the price.
* **Lack of Financial Data:** The absence of recent financial data prevents a thorough assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.
* **Limited Shareholding Data:** The provided shareholding data is outdated and insufficient for a comprehensive analysis.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and low liquidity make short-term trading extremely risky.  The current negative price momentum further strengthens this recommendation.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Don't Buy.**  Without access to comprehensive financial data and more recent corporate actions, a medium-term investment decision is not advisable. The high volatility remains a significant concern.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Hold (if you have stock), otherwise Don't Buy.**  While the dividend history is positive, the lack of financial data and the high volatility make a long-term buy recommendation impossible.  If already holding the stock, a "hold" decision might be considered, pending further analysis with updated financial data.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10): 4/10**

* Financial Health: 2/10 (Insufficient data)
* Market Performance: 3/10 (High volatility, negative recent price movement, low liquidity)
* Volatility and Risk: 2/10 (High volatility, low liquidity)

* Accuracy and clarity of the analysis: 8/10 (Analysis is clear and well-structured, despite data limitations)

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Due to the significant lack of crucial financial data and the high volatility coupled with low liquidity, a strong "Don't Buy" recommendation is given for short-term and medium-term investment horizons.  For long-term investors, a "Hold (if you have stock), otherwise Don't Buy" recommendation is made, contingent upon obtaining and analyzing updated financial data and corporate actions.
