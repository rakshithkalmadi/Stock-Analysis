**4. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

* While the recent financial performance shows improvement, particularly in Q2 FY25, the high volatility and low delivery-to-traded ratio indicate significant risk.  The consistent dividend payouts are positive, but the overall picture suggests caution.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign of stability.  More data is needed to assess the sustainability of the recent financial improvements.

**Conclusion:**

Aegis Logistics Limited shows some positive signs in its recent financial performance and consistent dividend payments. However, the high volatility and low delivery ratio present considerable risk.  Further investigation and monitoring are recommended before considering a buy decision.  A "Hold" recommendation is appropriate based on the current data.
