**3. Final Verdict:**

Based on the analysis of the provided data:

**Verdict: Don't Buy**

**Reasoning:**

While the company has a history of paying substantial dividends and recently announced a bonus issue, the most recent quarter's financial results show a significant decline in profit after tax and diluted EPS. This negative trend, coupled with the relatively high annual volatility, outweighs the positive aspects of the corporate actions.  The substantial drop in profitability in the latest quarter requires further investigation before considering a buy recommendation.  A "Hold" is not recommended because of the negative trend.  More information is needed to assess the reasons for the decline in profitability before a buy decision can be made.


**Conclusion:**

The recent decline in profitability and the high annual volatility present significant risks.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decline in profitability is necessary before a buy recommendation can be made.  The data suggests a cautious approach is warranted.
