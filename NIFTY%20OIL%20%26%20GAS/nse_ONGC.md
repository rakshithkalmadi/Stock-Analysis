**3. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

* While ONGC shows consistent profitability and dividend payouts, the recent price drop and moderate volatility suggest caution.  The relatively stable promoter holding is a positive sign.  Further analysis of the detailed financial results (XBRL links provided) would be necessary to make a more definitive judgment.  The current price is near the lower end of its recent range, suggesting a potential for recovery, but not enough to warrant a "Buy" recommendation without further investigation.

**Conclusion:**

ONGC demonstrates financial stability with consistent profitability and dividend distribution. However, recent price movements and moderate volatility warrant a cautious approach.  A "Hold" recommendation is given pending further analysis of the detailed financial statements and market conditions.  More information is needed to confidently recommend a "Buy" or "Sell".
