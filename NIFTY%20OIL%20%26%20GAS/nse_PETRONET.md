**3. Final Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

While the company shows consistent profitability and a stable promoter holding, the recent announcements regarding changes in management and cessation require further investigation before a "Buy" recommendation can be made with high confidence.  The relatively high annual volatility also suggests a degree of risk.  The current price is near the recent lows, suggesting a potential for upward movement, but not enough to justify a "Buy" recommendation without further information.  More data is needed to assess the impact of the management changes and the cessation announcement on the company's long-term prospects.  The consistent dividend payments are positive, but not sufficient to outweigh the uncertainties.

**Conclusion:**

Petronet LNG Limited demonstrates consistent profitability and a stable promoter shareholding. However, recent management changes and other announcements warrant further investigation before a definitive investment decision can be made.  A "Hold" recommendation is prudent until more information is available to assess the impact of these events on the company's future performance.
