**4. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the verdict is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

* While the recent dividend and bonus issue are positive, the significant volatility and inconsistent financial performance raise concerns.  The large swings in EPS and profit after tax across quarters require further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.  The high annual volatility (47%) points to a high-risk investment.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign, but not enough to outweigh the other factors.  More data and a deeper dive into the reasons for the fluctuating financial performance are needed before recommending a buy.

**Conclusion:**

HINDPETRO presents a mixed picture.  Positive corporate actions are countered by high volatility and inconsistent financial results.  A more thorough analysis, including an examination of the detailed financial statements and an understanding of the factors driving the fluctuations in profitability and EPS, is necessary before making a definitive investment decision.  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is appropriate based on the currently available data.
