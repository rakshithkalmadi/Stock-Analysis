* The company has a history of consistent dividend payouts.  Recent dividends are substantial.


**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* The week high and low show significant price volatility (₹306.10 to ₹570.35).  The CM Daily Volatility of 2.56% and CM Annual Volatility of 48.91% further confirm this.  This indicates a higher risk profile.


**2.6 Key Directors and Contact Info:**

**3. Recent Announcements:**

* Several announcements are listed, including board meeting outcomes, shareholder meeting notices, and newspaper publications.  Many relate to dividends and board meetings.


**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While IGL shows consistent revenue and generally positive profit after tax, the significant price volatility and relatively high risk profile warrant a "Hold" recommendation.  The consistent dividend payouts are a positive factor, but the recent price decline and high volatility outweigh this positive.  Further observation is needed to assess whether the current price represents a good entry point for a long-term investment.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign of stability.  More detailed analysis of the financial statements (beyond the provided summary data) would be beneficial for a more informed decision.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, IGL presents a mixed picture.  While the company demonstrates financial stability and a history of dividend payments, the high volatility introduces considerable risk.  A "Hold" recommendation is given pending further analysis and a clearer trend in price stability.
