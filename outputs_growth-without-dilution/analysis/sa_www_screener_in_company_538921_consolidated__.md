**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

The provided peer comparison data is limited.  A more thorough analysis requires a deeper dive into the financial performance of the peers and a more robust statistical comparison.  The median values provided offer a starting point but lack context without further analysis.

**7. Stock Valuation:**

A definitive valuation is impossible without complete financial data.  The P/E ratio of 17.1 is relatively low compared to some peers, but this needs to be considered in the context of growth prospects and risk.  The Price-to-Book ratio (Current Price/Book Value = 107/61.1 ≈ 1.75) suggests the stock might be slightly overvalued, but this is a preliminary assessment.

**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

Due to the incomplete data, assigning concrete recommendations with high confidence is not possible.  Further data extraction is absolutely necessary.

**9. Final Verdict:**

Raghuvansh Agrofarms Ltd. presents a mixed investment picture.  While the company shows some positive long-term growth trends, recent performance has been weak, particularly in sales and stock price.  The low promoter holding and reliance on other income raise concerns.  A comprehensive analysis requires extracting the missing data from the HTML tables to assess the company's financial health, operational efficiency, and true growth potential.  Only then can a confident investment recommendation be made.  **This analysis is incomplete and should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions.**
