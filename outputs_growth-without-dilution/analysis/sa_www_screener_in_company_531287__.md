## National Plastic Technologies Ltd: Comprehensive Financial Analysis

**1. Company Overview:**

National Plastic Technologies Ltd (NPTL), incorporated in 1989, operates in the plastic products sector, specifically manufacturing injection-molded plastic parts for the automotive and consumer durable industries.  A recent expansion into supplying EV components to two-wheeler manufacturers represents a strategic move into a high-growth market.  The provided data lacks information on its precise market position and specific achievements, limiting a complete competitive landscape assessment.

**2. Key Financial Metrics:**

* **Current Price:** ₹ 489
* **P/E Ratio:** 33.8
* **ROE:** 21.5%
* **ROCE:** 18.0%
* **Dividend Yield:** 0.20%
* **Market Capitalization:** ₹ 297 Cr.
* **Book Value:** ₹ 77.5

**3. Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

* **High ROE and ROCE:**  The ROE of 21.5% and ROCE of 18% indicate efficient capital utilization and profitability.
* **Strong Sales Growth (recent years):**  The data shows impressive sales growth, particularly over the last 3 and 5 years (44% and 28% CAGR respectively).  This suggests a healthy demand for the company's products.
* **Expansion into EV sector:**  Entering the EV market positions NPTL for potential future growth in a rapidly expanding industry.

**Weaknesses:**

* **High P/E Ratio:** A P/E ratio of 33.8 is relatively high, suggesting the stock might be overvalued compared to some industry peers (see below).  Further investigation is needed.
* **Lack of Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** The absence of this crucial metric hinders a complete assessment of the company's financial risk profile.
* **Inconsistent Profitability:** While recent years show strong profit growth, the historical data reveals fluctuations in profitability and even a negative tax percentage in some years, requiring further investigation into the reasons behind these inconsistencies.
* **Limited Information:** The lack of detailed market position information and competitive analysis is a significant weakness in this assessment.


**4. Performance Trends:**

* **Quarterly Results:** Sales show a generally upward trend, although there are some quarterly fluctuations.  Operating profit margins (OPM) are relatively stable, though they have shown some decline in recent quarters.  Net profit also shows an upward trend, but with significant year-to-year variations.
* **Annual Results:**  Annual sales and net profit show a generally positive trend, but with periods of slower growth and even decline.  OPM shows some volatility.
* **Balance Sheet Health:**  The balance sheet shows a significant increase in reserves and other assets over time, but also a substantial increase in borrowings, raising concerns about the company's leverage.  A detailed analysis of the debt-to-equity ratio is crucial for a complete assessment.
* **Cash Flow Trends:** The provided cash flow data is incomplete and shows a net cash flow of zero for all periods, which is highly unusual and requires further investigation and clarification.  This is a major red flag.

**5. Growth Metrics:**

The provided data shows impressive growth rates, particularly in the shorter timeframes:

* **Sales CAGR (10Y):** 14%
* **Sales CAGR (5Y):** 28%
* **Sales CAGR (3Y):** 44%
* **Sales CAGR (TTM):** 19%
* **Profit CAGR (10Y):** 20%
* **Profit CAGR (5Y):** 37%
* **Profit CAGR (3Y):** 84%
* **Profit CAGR (TTM):** 15%
* **Stock Price CAGR (10Y):** 38%
* **Stock Price CAGR (5Y):** 70%
* **Stock Price CAGR (3Y):** 89%
* **Stock Price CAGR (1Y):** 35%
* **ROE (10Y):** 11%
* **ROE (5Y):** 15%
* **ROE (3Y):** 18%
* **ROE (TTM):** 21%

These growth rates are strong, especially in the shorter term, but the sustainability of this growth needs further investigation.

**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Compared to its peers, NPTL has a lower market capitalization and significantly lower current price.  Its P/E ratio is relatively lower than some peers but higher than others.  Its ROCE is competitive with some peers but lower than others like Supreme Inds.  The provided peer comparison is limited and lacks a comprehensive analysis of relative valuation and competitive positioning.  The median P/E of peers is 35.27, suggesting NPTL's P/E of 33.8 is not drastically out of line, but the other metrics need more detailed comparison.

**7. Stock Valuation:**

Based on the available data, a definitive valuation is difficult. The high P/E ratio suggests potential overvaluation, but the strong growth rates and relatively high ROE and ROCE could justify a premium valuation.  The Price-to-Book ratio (Current Price/Book Value = 489/77.5 ≈ 6.3) is also high, further suggesting potential overvaluation.  A more in-depth discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and a thorough competitive analysis are needed for a more accurate valuation.

**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

Given the incomplete and inconsistent data, particularly concerning cash flow and the lack of a debt-to-equity ratio, assigning high confidence levels is not possible.  Further investigation is required.

* **Short-term (3-6 months):**  **Neutral**.  Confidence Level: **Low**.  Reasoning:  The short-term outlook is uncertain due to the data inconsistencies and the need for further investigation.
* **Medium-term (6-12 months):**  **Hold**. Confidence Level: **Low**. Reasoning:  The medium-term outlook depends on resolving the data inconsistencies and confirming the sustainability of the recent growth.
* **Long-term (1+ years):**  **Potentially Buy (conditional)**. Confidence Level: **Low**. Reasoning:  The long-term potential is linked to the success of the company's expansion into the EV sector.  However, this requires confirmation of the financial health and a more thorough competitive analysis.


**9. Final Verdict:**

National Plastic Technologies Ltd shows potential for growth, particularly in the EV sector. However, the analysis is hampered by significant data gaps and inconsistencies, especially concerning cash flow and the lack of key financial ratios.  Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to obtain a complete and verified financial statement, including a detailed balance sheet and cash flow statement, and conduct a thorough competitive analysis to assess the company's market position and long-term sustainability.  The current data is insufficient to provide high-confidence investment recommendations.  Further investigation is strongly recommended before any investment action is taken.
