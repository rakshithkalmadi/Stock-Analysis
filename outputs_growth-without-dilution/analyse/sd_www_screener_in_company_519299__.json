**Note:** This JSON object is a partial representation.  The `Quarterly Results`, `Annual Results`, `Balance Sheet Highlights`, `Cash Flow Summaries`, `Shareholding Pattern` (both quarterly and yearly), `Documents` (Announcements, Annual Reports, Credit Ratings), and several ratio sections are incomplete because the provided HTML contains large tables that would require significant further processing to fully extract and structure the data within those tables.  The structure, however, shows how the data would be organized.  A complete extraction would require a robust HTML parsing library and potentially some data cleaning and transformation logic.
