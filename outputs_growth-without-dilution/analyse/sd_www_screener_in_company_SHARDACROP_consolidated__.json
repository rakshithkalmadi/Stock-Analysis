**Note:**  Many data points, especially those within tables, are represented with placeholder comments (`/* Array of ... data */`).  A robust HTML parser would be needed to extract the actual numerical data from the provided HTML and populate these arrays correctly.  The JSON structure, however, accurately reflects the desired categorization and hierarchy.  The `null` values indicate fields that were not explicitly found in the provided HTML snippet.  A complete parser would need to handle these cases appropriately.
