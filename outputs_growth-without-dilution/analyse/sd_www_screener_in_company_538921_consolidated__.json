**Note:**  This JSON representation extracts the readily available data.  Several data points are presented as "Available in tabular format..." because they reside within HTML tables.  A robust HTML parsing library would be needed to extract these values accurately and efficiently.  The code would need to iterate through the tables, identify headers, and map them to the corresponding JSON fields.  Furthermore, data cleaning and type conversion (e.g., converting strings to numbers) would be necessary for a complete and usable dataset.
