**Note:**  This JSON representation is a best effort based on the provided HTML snippet.  A complete and accurate extraction would require processing the entire HTML document and potentially handling dynamic content loading.  Some fields like "Debt-to-Equity Ratio" and complete quarterly/annual data are missing because they weren't explicitly present in the provided HTML.  The "Performance Trends" section only includes a partial representation of the available data due to the length and complexity of the tables in the HTML.  A robust solution would involve more sophisticated HTML parsing and data cleaning techniques.
