**Note:**  This JSON representation is a partial example. The HTML provided contains a significant amount of data, especially within tables.  A complete JSON would require a robust HTML parser and potentially some heuristics to handle variations in table structures and data presentation.  The `Balance Sheet` and `Cash Flows` sections are shown with a sample structure to illustrate how the tabular data could be organized.  A real-world implementation would populate these sections completely.  Furthermore, some data points like "Market Cap / Sales", "EV / EBITDA", and "Price to Book" were not explicitly found in the provided HTML and are marked as `null`.  A more sophisticated parser might be able to infer or calculate these values based on other available data.
