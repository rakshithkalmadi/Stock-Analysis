**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant difference between the week's high and low.  The low market depth further amplifies this risk.  The provided data lacks specific risk metrics (e.g., Beta, Standard Deviation) for a more precise quantification of risk.


**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Relatively stable promoter holding.
* Presence in a growing pharmaceutical sector.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and low market depth.
* Inconsistent financial performance (profitability and EPS).
* Lack of detailed financial ratio data for thorough fundamental analysis.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price movement is relatively stable, but the high volatility and low market depth make short-term trading risky.  Waiting for clearer market trends is advisable.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The medium-term outlook depends on the company's ability to improve its financial performance consistency and the overall performance of the pharmaceutical sector.  Further research into the recent announcements is needed.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold.**  Glenmark's long-term prospects are tied to its ability to maintain its market position and innovate within the pharmaceutical industry.  However, a more in-depth fundamental analysis is required to make a definitive long-term recommendation.
