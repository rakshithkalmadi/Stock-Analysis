Shareholding patterns show minimal changes over the past year, indicating relative stability in ownership structure.


**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits significant volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The CM Daily Volatility (1.27%) and CM Annual Volatility (24.26%) further confirm this.  The low market depth adds to the risk profile, suggesting potential for sharp price movements.  The risk-reward profile is currently high risk, given the volatility and low market depth.


**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Established pharmaceutical company with a global presence.
* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Relatively stable shareholding pattern.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and low market depth.
* Fluctuating financial performance (requires further investigation).
* Dependence on the pharmaceutical industry's overall performance and regulatory changes.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price increase and high volatility make a short-term buy risky.  Holding allows for monitoring of price movements and potential short-term triggers.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The medium-term outlook depends on the company's ability to stabilize its financial performance and maintain its market position.  Further analysis of financial statements is crucial.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold/Consider Buy (with caution).**  The long-term prospects depend on the company's ability to innovate, adapt to market changes, and maintain its financial health.  A thorough fundamental analysis is necessary before considering a long-term buy.
