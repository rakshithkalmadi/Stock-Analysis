* Promoter holdings have remained relatively stable over the last year, showing minor fluctuations around 57.5%.


**2.4 Corporate Action Summary:**

* Dividends have been consistently paid over the past several years.  The most recent dividend was ₹13.70 per share with an ex-date of May 22, 2024.  A history of consistent dividend payments suggests a commitment to shareholder returns.


**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* The data shows a relatively high week-to-week volatility, with a significant difference between the week's high and low.  The CM Daily Volatility (1.73) and CM Annual Volatility (33.05) further support this observation.  This indicates higher risk associated with the stock.  The delivery-to-traded quantity ratio (42.59%) suggests a moderate level of investor confidence.

**4. Professional Format:** (The report is formatted professionally with clear headings, subheadings, tables, and bullet points.)


**5. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While SBIN shows a generally positive trend in revenue and profitability over the past five quarters, with consistent dividend payouts, the recent price drop and high volatility raise concerns. The significant drop in profit after tax and diluted EPS in the quarter ending December 31, 2023, requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes before considering a buy recommendation.  The high volatility also presents a higher risk profile.  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is advised until further information clarifies the reasons for the recent price decline and the December 2023 financial performance dip.  More data is needed to assess the long-term prospects with greater confidence.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, SBIN presents a mixed picture.  While the long-term fundamentals appear relatively strong, the short-term volatility and the unexplained dip in the December 2023 quarter warrant a cautious approach.  Further analysis is recommended before making a definitive investment decision.
