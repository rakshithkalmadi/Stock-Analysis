* Strong position in the power sector financing industry.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility.
* Frequent changes in key personnel and auditors (potential governance concerns requiring further investigation).
* Dependence on the power sector's performance.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price decline and low market depth suggest caution.  Waiting for clearer price direction is advisable.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold/Buy (depending on price action).**  If the price consolidates and shows signs of upward momentum, a buy position could be considered.  However, continued monitoring of financial performance and industry trends is crucial.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Buy.**  The consistent dividend payouts and strong sector positioning make REC Limited a potentially attractive long-term investment, provided the governance concerns are addressed.
