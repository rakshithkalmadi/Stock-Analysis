**3. Recent Announcements:**

The provided announcements are mostly related to news verification and volume spurts, and are not particularly insightful for current investment decisions.


**4. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

The lack of financial data prevents a thorough assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.  However, the current price shows a significant drop, high volatility, and the absence of promoter holdings are all negative indicators.  While the dividend history is positive, the high risk associated with the volatility outweighs this positive factor given the missing financial information.  Further investigation into the company's financial performance is crucial before considering any investment.


**Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data, the high volatility and the significant price drop make MCX a risky investment at this time.  The absence of financial data is a major constraint in making a confident recommendation.  A more thorough analysis incorporating financial statements is strongly recommended before making any investment decision.
