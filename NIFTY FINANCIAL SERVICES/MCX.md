* September 19, 2024: ₹7.64 per share

The shareholding pattern shows a consistent lack of promoter holding and a high public holding.  This could indicate a lack of management control and potentially higher volatility.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant difference between the week's high (₹7,048.6) and low (₹2,917.85). The CM Annual Volatility of 47.38% further confirms this high risk profile. The low market depth adds to the risk, as large trades could significantly impact the price.  The risk-reward profile appears unfavorable given the current volatility and lack of positive market momentum.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts (historical data).
* Established player in the Indian commodity derivatives market.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and significant price swings.
* Extremely low market depth, making it susceptible to manipulation.
* Lack of promoter holding, suggesting potential governance concerns.
* Missing crucial financial data prevents a thorough assessment of financial health.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility, low market depth, and recent negative price movement make a short-term investment highly risky.
* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Don't Buy.**  The lack of financial data and the high volatility continue to present significant risks.  Further information is needed to assess medium-term prospects.
* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  Without access to comprehensive financial data and given the high volatility and low market depth, a long-term investment is not recommended at this time.

* Financial health: 2/10 (Data unavailable)
* Market performance: 3/10 (High volatility, negative recent trend)

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the available data, MCX is not recommended for investment in the short, medium, or long term. The high volatility, extremely low market depth, and the absence of crucial financial information present significant risks that outweigh any potential benefits.  Further investigation and access to complete financial data are necessary before any investment decision can be made.  The lack of promoter holding is also a significant governance concern.
