**Key Financial Ratio Analysis (Limited by Data):**  The data reveals consistently negative profit after tax and negative EPS, indicating significant financial distress.  Further analysis of key ratios like debt-to-equity, current ratio, and operating margins is needed but impossible with the current data.

**4. Corporate Actions and Announcements:**

Recent announcements include changes in directors and key personnel, and upcoming shareholder meetings.  A significant interim dividend of ₹0.50 per share was paid in November 2018.  No other significant corporate actions are evident in the recent past.  The lack of recent corporate actions is a concern.

| Quarter      | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Shares held by Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| 30-Sep-2023  | 4.04                         | 95.96      | 0.00                             | 100.00    |
| 31-Dec-2023  | 4.04                         | 95.96      | 0.00                             | 100.00    |

| 30-Jun-2024  | 4.04                         | 95.96      | 0.00                             | 100.00    |
| 30-Sep-2024  | 4.04                         | 95.96      | 0.00                             | 100.00    |

Promoter and public shareholding remain largely unchanged over the past year.  This stability is a positive, but the low promoter holding is a potential concern.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits low short-term volatility based on the week's high and low. However, the historical data is insufficient to assess long-term volatility.  The consistent losses and low delivery percentage suggest significant risk.  The risk-reward profile is highly unfavorable given the current financial performance.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Relatively stable shareholding pattern.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* Consistent losses over the past five quarters.
* Negative EPS.
* Low delivery percentage suggesting speculative trading.
* Missing key financial ratios and sector PE data.
* Poor market depth data.
* Low promoter holding.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The negative price momentum, poor market depth, and ongoing losses make a short-term investment highly risky.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Don't Buy.**  The company's financial performance needs significant improvement before considering a medium-term investment.  The lack of positive catalysts makes this a high-risk proposition.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  Fundamental weaknesses and the lack of clear signs of a turnaround make a long-term investment highly speculative and risky.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10):** 3/10

* **Financial Health (2/10):**  Consistently negative profits and EPS.
* **Market Performance (2/10):** Negative price change and low delivery percentage.
* **Volatility and Risk (1/10):** High risk due to financial performance and low market depth.
* **Corporate Actions and Governance (0/10):** Limited recent corporate actions and insufficient data.

* **Accuracy and Clarity of Analysis (2/10):** Analysis is limited by data availability.
