**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and recent negative price movement make a short-term investment risky.  The low market depth adds to the risk.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  The medium-term outlook depends heavily on improved financial performance and clarification regarding the decrease in promoter holdings.  Further investigation into the recent announcements is crucial.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  The inconsistent financial performance and high volatility present significant long-term risks.  Fundamental improvements are needed before considering a long-term investment.
