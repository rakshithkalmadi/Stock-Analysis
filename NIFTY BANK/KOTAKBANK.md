* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Buy.**  The long-term fundamentals of the bank are strong, and the recent dip could present a buying opportunity for medium-term investors.  Monitoring financial performance and industry trends is crucial.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Buy.**  Kotak Mahindra Bank's strong market position, consistent dividend payouts, and generally positive revenue growth make it a potentially attractive long-term investment.
