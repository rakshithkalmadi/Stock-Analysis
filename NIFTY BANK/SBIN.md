* **Low Market Depth:**  This increases the risk of significant price swings.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price drop and low market depth suggest caution.  Waiting for clearer price direction is advisable.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Buy.**  The long-term fundamentals of SBIN, its market position, and consistent revenue growth make it a potentially attractive investment over the medium term.  However, volatility should be considered.
