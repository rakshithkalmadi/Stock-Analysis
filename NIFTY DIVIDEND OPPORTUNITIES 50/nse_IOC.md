**3. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

The sharp decline in profitability and EPS over the last two quarters is a significant red flag. While the consistent promoter holding and history of dividend payouts are positive, the recent financial performance outweighs these factors. The high volatility also adds to the risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decline in profitability is necessary before considering any investment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided financial data, IOC shows a concerning trend of declining profitability and EPS.  While the company has a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and has stable promoter holdings, the current financial performance warrants a "Don't Buy" recommendation until further clarification on the recent performance is available.
