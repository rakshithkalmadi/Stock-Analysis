**3. Final Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

While the company shows a generally positive financial performance with increasing revenue, profit, and EPS, the recent price drop and relatively high volatility raise concerns.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign, and the dividend payouts are attractive. However, the recent downward price movement and the lack of information on the reasons behind the recent announcements warrant a cautious approach.  More information is needed to assess the long-term prospects and the impact of the recent management changes and announcements before considering a buy.

**Conclusion:**

Cummins India Limited demonstrates a generally healthy financial performance, but recent price action and announcements suggest a period of uncertainty.  A "Hold" recommendation allows for further observation and analysis before making a more decisive investment decision.  Further investigation into the recent announcements and a deeper dive into the company's long-term strategy is recommended.
