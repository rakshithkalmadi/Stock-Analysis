**2.1 Current Price Analysis:**

* The current price (81.40) is significantly lower than the previous close (84.44) and the pre-open price (84.44), indicating a negative market reaction.
* The price is also below the week's high (118.40) but above the week's low (58.00).

* Profit after tax and EPS are volatile, with significant changes quarter to quarter.  The most recent quarter shows a decrease in profit compared to the previous quarter.

* Regular dividend payments indicate a commitment to shareholder returns.

**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* High annual volatility (46.62%) suggests the stock is relatively risky.

**3. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While NHPC shows consistent revenue and regular dividend payments, the recent price drop, decreasing promoter holdings, and high volatility raise concerns.  The fluctuating profitability and EPS also add to the uncertainty.  More data and a clearer trend in financial performance are needed before recommending a buy.  A "hold" recommendation allows for further observation and analysis before making a more decisive investment decision.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, NHPC presents a mixed picture.  While the company pays dividends and has relatively stable revenue, the recent price decline, reduced promoter holdings, and high volatility suggest a cautious approach.  Further monitoring of financial performance and market trends is recommended before considering a buy.
