**3. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

**Reasoning:**

While Canara Bank shows an upward trend in income, the recent price drop and high annual volatility raise concerns.  The consistent promoter holding suggests confidence in the company's long-term prospects.  However, the significant fluctuation in EPS (likely due to the stock split) and the high volatility make a "Buy" recommendation premature.  More data and analysis are needed to assess the true impact of the stock split and the overall financial health of the bank.  A "Hold" allows for further observation before making a decisive investment decision.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, Canara Bank presents a mixed picture.  Positive aspects include stable promoter holdings and increasing income.  However, recent price declines, high volatility, and the need for further analysis of EPS figures following the stock split suggest a cautious approach.  A "Hold" recommendation is the most prudent course of action at this time.
