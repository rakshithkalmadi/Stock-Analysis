**Reasoning:**

While the recent dividend payments are positive, the inconsistent financial performance, high volatility, and decreasing promoter holdings raise significant concerns.  The substantial drop in price from the week high and the negative pre-open activity further support this recommendation.  The lack of clarity regarding the "Cessation" announcement also adds to the uncertainty.  The unusually low total traded volume in the market data also raises concerns about the accuracy of the data provided.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the inconsistent financial performance and the decrease in promoter holdings is crucial before considering any investment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, Union Bank of India stock presents a high-risk profile with inconsistent financial performance and concerning trends in shareholding.  A "Don't Buy" recommendation is given until further clarification and improved financial performance are observed.
