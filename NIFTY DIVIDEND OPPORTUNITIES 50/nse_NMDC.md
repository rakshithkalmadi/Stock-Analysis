**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While NMDC shows generally positive financial performance with consistent promoter holding and upcoming bonus issue, the recent price drop and relatively high volatility suggest caution.  The current price is below the week high and the recent announcements don't provide strong enough signals for a buy recommendation.  More data, particularly on historical volatility and future growth prospects, is needed before recommending a buy.  The current situation warrants a "hold" until further information is available.


**5. Conclusion:**

Based solely on the provided data, NMDC presents a mixed picture.  Positive financial results and corporate actions are counterbalanced by recent price decline and relatively high volatility.  A "hold" recommendation is prudent until further analysis can clarify the underlying factors influencing the stock price.
