**2.7 Recent Announcements:**

**3. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While IGL shows consistent revenue and a history of dividend payouts, the recent decline in EPS and relatively high volatility raise concerns.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign, but the lack of significant growth in key financial metrics over the past year doesn't justify a "Buy" recommendation.  More data and a clearer trend in EPS would be needed before recommending a "Buy".  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is appropriate based on the current data.


**4. Conclusion:**

Based on the provided financial data and corporate actions, Indraprastha Gas Limited presents a mixed picture.  While the company demonstrates consistent dividend payments and stable promoter holdings, the recent fluctuations in profitability and EPS warrant a cautious approach.  Further observation of financial performance and market trends is recommended before considering a purchase.
