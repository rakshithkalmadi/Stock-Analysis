* EPS also shows a generally positive trend.


**2.3 Shareholding Analysis:**

* Promoter holding remains stable at 50%, indicating no significant change in ownership structure.


**2.4 Corporate Action Summary:**

* Consistent dividend payments, including interim and special dividends, suggest a healthy financial position.


**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* Daily volatility (1.84) and annual volatility (35.15) need to be compared to industry benchmarks to assess the risk level accurately.  Without benchmarks, a definitive statement on risk cannot be made.


**3. Final Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

* While the financial performance shows a generally positive trend, the volatility needs further context (industry comparison) before a strong buy recommendation can be made.
* Consistent dividend payouts are positive, but not sufficient to justify a buy on their own.
* The stable promoter holding is a positive sign of stability.
* The recent announcements regarding changes in management and cessation require further investigation to assess their potential impact.

**Conclusion:**

Petronet LNG Limited shows signs of financial health with consistent profitability and dividend payments. However, without a comparison to industry benchmarks for volatility and a deeper understanding of the recent management changes, a more decisive recommendation cannot be made.  Further investigation into the recent announcements is recommended before considering a buy.  A "Hold" strategy allows for further observation and data gathering before making a more informed investment decision.
