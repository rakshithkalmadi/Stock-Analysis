A significant decrease in promoter holding in December 2024 is a major concern and requires further investigation into the reasons behind this change.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The CM Annual Volatility of 45.85% further confirms this.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards risk due to the recent price decline and the substantial losses reported in the financial statements.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Strong brand reputation in the Indian real estate market.
* Potential for long-term growth in the Indian real estate sector.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and significant price swings.
* Recent substantial losses in financial performance.
* Significant decrease in promoter shareholding.
* Dependence on the cyclical nature of the real estate market.
* Lack of sufficient data to fully assess financial health.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The recent price drop and high volatility suggest a high risk of further decline in the short term.  The negative financial performance also adds to this risk.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  The medium-term outlook depends heavily on the company's ability to address the issues highlighted in the financial statements and the reasons behind the drop in promoter shareholding.  Further investigation is needed before considering a buy.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  Long-term prospects depend on the overall growth of the Indian real estate market and the company's ability to improve its financial performance and regain investor confidence.  The current situation presents significant risk.
