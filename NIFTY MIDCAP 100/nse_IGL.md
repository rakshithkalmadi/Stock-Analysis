**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While IGL has a history of consistent dividend payouts and stable promoter holdings, the recent decline in profit after tax and diluted EPS, coupled with relatively high volatility, raises concerns.  The significant drop in EPS in the latest quarter warrants further investigation before considering a buy.  A "hold" recommendation allows for monitoring of future financial performance and market trends before making a more decisive investment decision.  The consistent dividend payouts provide some support for the "hold" recommendation.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, IGL presents a mixed picture.  While the company has a history of dividend payments and stable promoter holdings, recent financial performance shows some weakness.  Further observation is needed to assess whether this is a temporary downturn or a more significant trend.  Therefore, a "hold" recommendation is the most prudent course of action.
