**3. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

* While the recent financial performance shows an improving trend in income, profit after tax, and EPS, the current price movement indicates a significant drop.  The substantial price volatility and the lack of promoter holding are significant concerns.  The high PE ratio also suggests the stock might be overvalued.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and the lack of promoter holding is necessary before considering a buy.  The consistent dividend payouts are positive, but not enough to outweigh the other concerns.

**Conclusion:**

BSE Limited shows some positive financial indicators, but the current price action, high volatility, and absence of promoter holding raise significant concerns.  A "Hold" recommendation is advised until further information clarifies the reasons behind the recent price decline and the long-term growth prospects of the company.  More detailed analysis of the financial statements and market depth is recommended before making any investment decision.
