**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While HUDCO shows a generally positive trend in financial performance with increasing income and profit after tax, the significant decrease in promoter holdings raises concerns.  A 6.81% drop in promoter holdings over the past year requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.  Until more information is available to clarify this significant change in shareholding, a "Hold" recommendation is prudent.  The high volatility also adds to the risk.  The consistent dividend payments are a positive factor.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, HUDCO presents a mixed picture.  Positive financial performance is offset by a concerning drop in promoter holdings and relatively high volatility.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decrease in promoter holdings is crucial before considering a "Buy" recommendation.  Therefore, a "Hold" is the most appropriate recommendation at this time.
