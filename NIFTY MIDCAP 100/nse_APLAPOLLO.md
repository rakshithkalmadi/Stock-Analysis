**3. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

**Reasoning:**

While the company has a history of dividend payouts and bonus issues, the recent financial results show inconsistent profitability and a significant drop in EPS in the most recent quarter.  The decrease in promoter holdings, although not alarming, adds to the cautious outlook.  The high volatility also contributes to the risk.  More data is needed to assess the sustainability of the business model and future prospects with higher confidence.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent drop in EPS is recommended before considering a buy.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, a "Hold" recommendation is given due to inconsistent financial performance, moderate to high volatility, and a slight decrease in promoter holdings.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the recent dip in EPS is a temporary anomaly or a sign of a larger trend.
