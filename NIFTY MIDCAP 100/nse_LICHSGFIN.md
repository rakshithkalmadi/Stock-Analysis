**3. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While the company shows consistent dividend payouts and generally stable income, the recent downward price movement and slight decline in profit after tax in the last quarter raise concerns.  The high volatility also adds to the risk.  More data and analysis would be needed to determine if the recent decline is a temporary fluctuation or a sign of a larger trend.  Given the current information, a "Hold" recommendation is the most prudent course of action.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent decline in profit and the nature of the high volatility is recommended before considering a buy.


**Conclusion:**

Based solely on the provided data, LIC Housing Finance Limited presents a mixed picture.  While the dividend history is positive and promoter holding is stable, recent financial performance and price action warrant a cautious approach.  A "Hold" recommendation is advised until further information clarifies the current trends.
