**3. Recent Announcements:**

* Several announcements related to loss of share certificates and clarification on financial results.  One announcement mentions a "spurt in volume," which warrants further investigation into the underlying cause.  The resignation of an independent director is also noted.


**4. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

While the company has declared dividends, the recent financial performance is highly volatile and shows losses in two of the last four quarters.  The high volatility metrics (daily and annual) indicate significant risk.  The 0 Symbol PE needs further clarification.  Although promoter holding is stable, the overall financial picture and high volatility outweigh the positive aspects.  The recent announcements do not provide sufficient positive information to justify a buy recommendation.


**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided financial data and volatility metrics, FACT presents a high-risk investment with inconsistent profitability.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the 0 Symbol PE and the "spurt in volume" is recommended before considering any investment.  The current data does not support a buy recommendation.
