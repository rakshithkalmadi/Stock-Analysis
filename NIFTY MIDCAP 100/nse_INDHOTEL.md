**5. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While the company shows some positive signs in terms of revenue growth and dividend payments, the significant volatility (37.06% annual volatility) and inconsistent profitability (fluctuating EPS) present considerable risk.  The recent price drop and relatively stable promoter holdings don't provide a strong enough signal to recommend a buy.  More data and a clearer trend in profitability are needed before considering a buy recommendation.  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is advised based on the provided data.

**Conclusion:**

INDHOTEL exhibits a mixed picture.  While revenue growth is present, the high volatility and inconsistent profitability warrant caution.  Further observation is recommended before making a decisive investment decision.
