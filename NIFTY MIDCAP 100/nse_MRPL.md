**5. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

While the consistent high promoter holding suggests some level of confidence, the highly volatile price action, coupled with the inconsistent and recently negative financial performance (significant loss in the most recent quarter), presents a high-risk profile.  The relatively small dividends do not compensate for the substantial risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent loss is needed before considering any investment.

**Conclusion:**

Based solely on the provided data, MRPL presents a high-risk investment due to its volatile price and inconsistent financial performance.  The recent quarterly loss is a significant negative factor.  A more thorough due diligence, including an analysis of the reasons behind the recent loss and future projections, is strongly recommended before considering an investment.
