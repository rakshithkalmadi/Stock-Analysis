**3. Final Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

While the company shows consistent profitability and a history of dividend payouts, the recent price drop, moderate to high volatility, and slight decrease in promoter holding raise some concerns.  The financial performance is not exceptionally strong to justify a "Buy" recommendation in the face of these risks.  More information is needed to determine if the price drop is temporary or indicative of a larger trend.  A "Hold" allows for further observation before making a more decisive decision.

**Conclusion:**

Astral Limited demonstrates consistent profitability and a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and bonus issues. However, recent price volatility and a slight decrease in promoter holdings warrant a cautious approach.  Further monitoring of the company's performance and shareholding patterns is recommended before considering a buy or sell decision.
