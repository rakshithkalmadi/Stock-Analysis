**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

**Reasoning:**

While the financial performance shows a generally positive trend in income, profit, and EPS, the significant drop in price today (-4.17%) warrants caution.  The pre-open market indicated strong buying interest, suggesting a potential disconnect between expectations and the actual market reaction.  The consistent dividend payments are positive, but the high volatility is a concern.  Promoter holding remains stable, which is a positive sign.  More data is needed to determine if the price drop is a temporary correction or the start of a larger downward trend.  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is given until further information is available.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, KPIT Technologies shows signs of growth, but the recent price drop and high volatility introduce uncertainty.  A "Hold" strategy allows for further observation before making a buy or sell decision.  Further analysis of the reasons behind the price drop and future financial projections would be beneficial.
