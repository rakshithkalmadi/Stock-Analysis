The consistent dividend payouts and stable promoter holding further support this assessment.  The moderate annual volatility suggests a moderate level of risk.  More information is needed to make a definitive buy or sell decision.  The recent announcements do not provide sufficient information to alter this assessment.

**Conclusion:**

PI Industries Limited shows signs of financial health with consistent profitability and dividend payments. However, the recent price drop warrants caution.  A "Hold" recommendation is appropriate pending further analysis and clarification on recent announcements.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop is recommended before considering a buy or sell decision.
