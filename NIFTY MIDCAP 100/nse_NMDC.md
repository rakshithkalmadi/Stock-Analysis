**3. Final Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided data, the recommendation is a **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

* While the financial performance shows some positive trends in income and profit, the EPS is inconsistent, suggesting some uncertainty in profitability.
* The consistent promoter holding indicates stability, but the moderate to high volatility presents some risk.
* The upcoming bonus issue is positive for shareholders, but the current price movement is relatively flat.

**Conclusion:**

NMDC Limited shows signs of both strength (consistent promoter holding, dividend payouts, bonus issue) and weakness (inconsistent EPS, moderate to high volatility).  More detailed analysis, including a deeper dive into the financial statements and a longer-term perspective on price movements and volatility, is recommended before making a buy or sell decision.  The current data does not provide sufficient evidence to confidently recommend a buy.  A "hold" strategy allows for further observation and analysis before committing to a more decisive action.
