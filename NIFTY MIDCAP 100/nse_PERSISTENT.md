**4. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

While the company shows consistent revenue and profitability, the significant price drop, high volatility, decreasing promoter holding, and highly variable EPS raise serious concerns.  The large fluctuations in EPS across quarters require further investigation to determine the underlying causes.  The high volatility suggests a high-risk investment.  Until these concerns are addressed and a clearer picture of the company's financial stability emerges, a "Don't Buy" recommendation is warranted.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, Persistent Systems Limited presents a high-risk profile due to its significant price decline, high volatility, and inconsistent EPS.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the fluctuating EPS and the decrease in promoter holdings before considering an investment.  The substantial dividend payouts are a positive factor, but they are not sufficient to outweigh the other risks.
