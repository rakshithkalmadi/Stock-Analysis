* Consistent dividend payouts suggest a commitment to shareholder returns.


**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* **CM Daily Volatility:** 2.7 (This metric needs context; a comparison to industry averages would be beneficial)

The high annual volatility suggests a relatively risky investment.  The low delivery percentage suggests a higher proportion of speculative trading.


**2.6 Key Directors and Contact Info:**

* **Registrar:** MCS Limited,  admin@mcsregistrars.com, www.mcsregistrars.com
* **Company Contact:** Ispat Bhavan, Lodhi Road, NEW DELHI - 110003, secy.sail@sail.in, www.sail.co.in

**3. Recent Announcements:**

Multiple announcements regarding changes in directors and key personnel were made in November and December 2024.  Details are available in the provided data.


**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While SAIL shows consistent promoter holding and regular dividend payouts, the significant volatility in financial performance (particularly profit after tax and EPS), coupled with high annual volatility and a relatively low delivery-to-traded ratio, raises concerns.  The recent changes in key personnel also introduce an element of uncertainty.  More data and a longer-term trend analysis would be needed to confidently recommend a buy.  The current situation warrants a "hold" until further information clarifies the financial performance and the impact of the personnel changes.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, SAIL presents a mixed picture.  Positive aspects include consistent promoter holdings and dividend payments. However, the volatility in financial results and the high stock volatility suggest a cautious approach.  Further analysis and observation are recommended before considering a buy or sell decision.
