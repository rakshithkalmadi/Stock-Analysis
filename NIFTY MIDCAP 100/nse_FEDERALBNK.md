**5. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

**Reasoning:**

While the financial performance of FEDERALBNK shows a generally positive trend in income, profit after tax, and EPS over the last five quarters, the extremely high volatility and the complete absence of promoter holding are significant concerns.  The 0% promoter holding raises serious questions about management's commitment and long-term vision for the company.  The high volatility increases the risk of significant losses.  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is given until further information clarifies the situation regarding promoter shareholding and reduces the volatility.  More investigation is needed before considering a "Buy" decision.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, FEDERALBNK presents a mixed picture.  Positive financial performance is offset by high volatility and the absence of promoter ownership.  A "Hold" verdict is the most prudent course of action until further information is available.
