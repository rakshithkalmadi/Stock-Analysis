The company's financial performance is highly concerning.  The consistent losses over the past eight quarters, culminating in a significant loss in Q1 2024, present a substantial risk. While there's some improvement in recent quarters, the overall trend is negative.  The high volatility further exacerbates the risk.  The absence of promoter holding also raises concerns about management commitment and long-term vision.  Although the recent announcements mention capital alteration and fund raising, the impact of these actions on the company's financial health is not evident from the provided data.

**Conclusion:**

Based solely on the provided financial data and the company's prolonged period of losses, investing in POLICYBZR at this time carries significant risk.  Further investigation and a more positive financial trend are needed before considering a purchase.
