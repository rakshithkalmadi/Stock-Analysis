The most concerning factor is the consistent 0% promoter holding, indicating a lack of confidence from the company's leadership.  This is a significant red flag.  The absence of recent dividend announcements also suggests a lack of confidence in future profitability.

Based solely on the provided data, Yes Bank Limited presents a high-risk investment with inconsistent profitability and a concerning lack of promoter confidence.  Further investigation and analysis beyond the provided data are strongly recommended before considering any investment.
