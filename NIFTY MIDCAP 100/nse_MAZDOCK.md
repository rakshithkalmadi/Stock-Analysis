* **CM Daily Volatility:** 3.7 (This metric needs context from the data source to interpret properly.  It's likely a percentage or a standardized measure.)
* **CM Annual Volatility:** 70.69 (Similar to daily volatility, context is needed for proper interpretation. Likely a percentage.)
* **Delivery to Traded Quantity:** 22.74% (Relatively low delivery percentage suggests a higher proportion of speculative trading.)

**2.6 Key Directors and Contact Info:**

* **Chairperson & Executive Director-MD:** SANJEEV SINGHAL
* **Registrar:** Alankit Assignments Limited (Contact details provided in data)
* **Company Website:** www.mazagondock.in


**3. Recent Announcements (Selection):**

* Multiple press releases in December 2024.
* Changes in Directors/Key Managerial Personnel announced in December 2024.


**4. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the verdict is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

* While the financial performance shows profitability, the recent price drop is significant.  The low delivery percentage suggests a high level of speculative trading, increasing risk.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign of stability.  The upcoming face value split and dividend payouts are positive factors. However, given the recent price volatility and the need for further observation of the impact of recent corporate actions and announcements, a "Hold" recommendation is more prudent than a "Buy" at this time.

**Conclusion:**

MAZDOCK shows signs of both strength (consistent promoter holding, dividend payouts) and weakness (recent price drop, high volatility, low delivery percentage).  More data and time are needed to assess the long-term impact of recent corporate actions and market behavior before a confident "Buy" recommendation can be made.  A "Hold" allows for further observation and analysis before making a decision.
