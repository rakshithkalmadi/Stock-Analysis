**3. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

While the company shows consistent dividend payouts and relatively stable promoter holdings, the recent decline in EPS and the moderate annual volatility raise some concerns.  The recent financial results show a decrease in profit after tax compared to the previous quarters.  Further observation is needed to determine if this is a temporary trend or a sign of a larger issue.  The current price is near its recent lows, suggesting a potential for upward movement, but the lack of significant positive momentum warrants a "Hold" recommendation rather than a "Buy".

**Conclusion:**

Apollo Tyres Limited presents a mixed picture.  While the dividend history and stable promoter holdings are positive signs, the recent dip in EPS and moderate volatility suggest a cautious approach.  More data is needed to assess the sustainability of the recent financial performance before recommending a "Buy".  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is appropriate at this time.
