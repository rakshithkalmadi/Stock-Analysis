While the financial performance shows a positive trend and the recent dividend is encouraging, the significant drop in promoter holding between September 30th and October 5th raises serious concerns.  This unexpected decrease requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.  Until more information is available to clarify this significant change in shareholding, a "Hold" recommendation is the most prudent course of action.  The high annual volatility also adds to the risk.  Further due diligence is needed before considering a buy.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, Bank of Maharashtra shows positive financial performance, but the substantial decrease in promoter holdings necessitates a cautious approach.  More information is needed to assess the implications of this change before a buy recommendation can be made.
