**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

While the recent dividend is positive, the significant price drop, high volatility, and inconsistent profitability raise serious concerns.  The volatile financial performance, with losses in the most recent quarter, outweighs the positive aspects of the dividend.  The high volatility suggests a high-risk investment.  The data does not provide sufficient evidence to support a "Buy" recommendation.  A "Hold" is also not recommended due to the negative recent financial performance and high risk.


**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, TATACOMM presents a high-risk investment with inconsistent financial performance.  Further investigation and a more comprehensive analysis are recommended before considering any investment.  The current data does not support a buy decision.
