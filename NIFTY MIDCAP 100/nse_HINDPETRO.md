**3. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:** While the company has declared dividends and a bonus issue, indicating some positive internal sentiment, the significant volatility in financial performance (profitability and EPS) and the high annual volatility present considerable risk.  The recent price decline also adds to the negative outlook.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the volatile financial results before considering an investment.  The high volatility makes this a risky investment at the current time.

**Conclusion:** Based on the provided data, HINDPETRO exhibits high volatility and inconsistent financial performance.  Until a clearer picture of the underlying factors driving this volatility emerges, a "Don't Buy" recommendation is warranted.  More detailed financial analysis and understanding of the reasons for the fluctuations in profit and EPS are crucial before a different recommendation can be made.
