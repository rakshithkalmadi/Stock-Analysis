|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 23-Sep-2024 | Annual General Meeting/Dividend - ₹ 0.85/share |

*  The company has a history of paying dividends, both interim and annual.  The recent stock split may have influenced the price.


**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* **CM Daily Volatility:** 2.87 (This metric needs context from the source to understand its significance.  Higher values generally indicate higher risk.)
* **CM Annual Volatility:** 54.83 (Similar to daily volatility, context is needed. Higher values suggest higher risk.)
* **Delivery to Traded Quantity:** 55.5% (A relatively high percentage, suggesting a significant portion of trades result in actual delivery, which can be interpreted as a positive sign of long-term investment.)

The volatility metrics suggest a relatively high-risk investment.  However, the high delivery-to-traded ratio suggests a degree of long-term investor confidence.

**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

**Reasoning:**

While BDL shows periods of strong profitability and consistent dividend payments, the significant volatility in both revenue and profitability across quarters presents a considerable risk.  The high volatility metrics further support this assessment. Although promoter holding is stable, the fluctuating financial performance makes a "Buy" recommendation too risky.  A "Hold" allows for further observation of the company's performance before making a more decisive investment decision.  The high delivery-to-traded ratio suggests some long-term investor confidence, but this alone is not sufficient to outweigh the financial volatility.

**Conclusion:**

BDL's financial performance is highly variable, making it a high-risk investment despite consistent promoter holdings and a history of dividend payments.  Further monitoring of the company's financial performance is recommended before considering a purchase.  The "Hold" recommendation is based on the observed volatility and lack of consistent financial growth.
