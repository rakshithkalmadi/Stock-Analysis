**3. Final Verdict:**

**Don't Buy.**

**Reasoning:**

The recent financial performance of ABFRL is concerning, showing a significant loss in the most recent quarter and inconsistent profitability over the past year.  The substantial decrease in promoter holdings raises serious questions about the company's future prospects. While the rights issue in 2020 might have been a positive move, the current financial situation and the drop in promoter confidence outweigh any potential benefits. The high volatility adds to the risk.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the declining promoter holdings and the recent losses is crucial before considering any investment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, ABFRL presents a high-risk investment with uncertain future prospects. The negative financial performance and the significant reduction in promoter holdings strongly suggest avoiding this stock at the present time.  More information is needed to assess the underlying causes of these trends before a different recommendation could be considered.
