**4. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

While the financial performance shows an improving trend in revenue and profit, the high volatility and the fact that the company is still reporting a profit loss after tax present significant risk.  The consistently high promoter holding suggests confidence from insiders, but this alone is not sufficient to justify a "Buy" recommendation.  Further investigation into the "Raising of Funds" and "General Updates" announcements is needed before a stronger recommendation can be made.  The current price movement suggests a period of consolidation might be appropriate before considering a buy.


**5. Conclusion:**

Based solely on the provided data, IDBI Bank Limited presents a mixed picture.  Positive aspects include increasing revenue and profit, high promoter holding, and a recent dividend. However, high volatility and the need for further clarification on recent announcements make a "Hold" recommendation the most prudent course of action at this time.  More information is needed to assess the long-term prospects of the company with greater confidence.
