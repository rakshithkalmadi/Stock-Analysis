**2. Key Indicators:**

**2.1 Current Price Analysis:**

* The current price (4850) is significantly lower than the previous close (5028.55), indicating a downward trend.
* It's also below the pre-open high (5093.95) but above the week low (3601).

**2.2 Financial Performance:**

* Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally positive growth over the last five quarters.
* Profitability (both before and after tax) is positive in all five quarters, although there is some quarter-to-quarter variation.
* Diluted EPS is also positive and shows some variation.

**2.3 Shareholding Analysis:**

* Consistent dividend payouts over the past several years, indicating a commitment to returning value to shareholders.  Recent dividends are substantial.

**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* The CM Daily Volatility (2.38) and CM Annual Volatility (45.47) suggest moderate to high volatility.  This needs further investigation with a longer time series.

**3. Final Verdict:**

Based solely on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

While the company shows consistent profitability and a history of dividend payouts, the recent price drop (-3.55%) and moderate to high volatility raise concerns.  The lack of significant positive news in recent announcements also contributes to a cautious outlook.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and a longer-term analysis of volatility are recommended before considering a buy.

**Conclusion:**

Supreme Industries Limited demonstrates financial strength with consistent profitability and dividend payments. However, recent price volatility and the absence of positive news warrant a "Hold" recommendation until further information is available.  More data is needed to assess the long-term growth potential and risk profile accurately.
