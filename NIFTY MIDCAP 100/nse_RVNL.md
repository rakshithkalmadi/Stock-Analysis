**3. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

While RVNL shows consistent profitability and a stable promoter holding, the high volatility and significant price drop on December 20th raise concerns.  The recent announcements regarding changes in directors also warrant further investigation before considering a buy.  The positive financial performance and dividend history are encouraging, but the high risk associated with the volatility makes a "Buy" recommendation premature.  More data and analysis are needed to assess the underlying reasons for the price fluctuations.

**Conclusion:**

RVNL presents a mixed picture.  Positive financial performance and consistent dividend payouts are offset by high volatility and recent price decline.  A "Hold" strategy allows for further observation and analysis before making a decisive buy or sell decision.  Investors should monitor the company's announcements and financial performance closely.
