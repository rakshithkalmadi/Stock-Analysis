The provided data lacks this information.

|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------|-----------|
| 31-Dec-2023  | 86.46                        | 13.54      | 0.00               | 100.00    |
| 31-Mar-2024  | 86.46                        | 13.54      | 0.00               | 100.00    |

**Analysis:**  A significant drop in promoter holding is observed in October 2024. This requires further investigation to understand the reasons behind this change.  This could be a significant negative factor.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits moderate to high volatility, as evidenced by the week high and low prices.  The CM Daily Volatility (2.55%) and CM Annual Volatility (48.72%) further confirm this.  The low market depth adds to the risk, as it increases the potential for sharp price movements.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards risk due to the recent volatility and the unexplained drop in promoter holding.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent (though moderating) growth in revenue and profit after tax over the past five quarters.
* Dividend payout history.
* Relatively high delivery percentage indicating genuine buying interest.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and low market depth.
* Significant unexplained drop in promoter shareholding.
* Lack of key financial ratios for a complete assessment.
* Dependence on the overall performance of the public sector banking sector.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold/Don't Buy.** The recent price increase and high volatility make a short-term buy risky.  The unexplained drop in promoter holding adds to the uncertainty.
* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The medium-term outlook depends heavily on clarifying the reasons behind the promoter shareholding decrease and the overall performance of the banking sector.  Further investigation is needed.
* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  While the bank shows some positive financial performance, the high volatility and the significant drop in promoter holding raise serious concerns.  More information is needed to assess long-term viability.

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the available data, MAHABANK presents a mixed picture. While the financial performance shows some positive trends, the high volatility, low market depth, and the significant drop in promoter holding raise serious concerns.  Until the reasons for the promoter shareholding decrease are clarified and a more comprehensive financial analysis is conducted, a cautious approach is recommended.  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is given for the medium term, while "Don't Buy" is recommended for both short-term and long-term investment horizons.
