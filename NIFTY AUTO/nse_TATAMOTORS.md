The inconsistent profitability and EPS across quarters also add to the uncertainty.  The data suggests a period of instability and uncertainty for the company, making it a risky investment at this time.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the drop in promoter holdings is warranted before considering any investment.

**Conclusion:** Based on the provided financial and market data, the current state of TATAMOTORS stock presents a high-risk profile.  The significant price drop, decreased promoter holdings, and volatile performance outweigh the positive aspects of recent dividends.  A "Don't Buy" recommendation is given until further clarification on the recent market activity and shareholding changes is available.
