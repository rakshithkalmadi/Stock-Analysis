Based on the provided data, the recommendation is **Don't Buy**.

**Reasoning:**

* The inconsistent profitability and fluctuating EPS over the last five quarters indicate a lack of stable financial performance.
* The significant decrease in promoter holdings raises concerns about the company's future direction and stability.
* The high volatility adds considerable risk to the investment.  While dividends are positive, the overall financial picture is not strong enough to offset the risks.

**Conclusion:**

While MOTHERSON has a history of corporate actions beneficial to shareholders, the recent decline in promoter holdings and inconsistent financial performance outweigh the positives.  Further investigation and a more comprehensive analysis are recommended before considering an investment.
