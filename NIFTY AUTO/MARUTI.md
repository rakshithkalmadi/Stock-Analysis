* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Relatively high delivery percentage in recent trading.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility.
* Low market depth, limiting liquidity.
* Fluctuations in quarterly financial performance require further investigation.
* Dependence on the Indian automotive market, susceptible to economic downturns.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price decline and low market depth suggest caution.  Waiting for clearer price momentum is advisable.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The company's fundamentals are generally strong, but the recent financial performance needs further scrutiny.  Monitoring upcoming announcements related to the share purchase agreement is crucial.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Buy.**  Maruti Suzuki's market position and history of dividend payouts make it a potentially attractive long-term investment, provided the company can maintain its financial performance and navigate market challenges.
