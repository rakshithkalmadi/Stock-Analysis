**Note:**  This JSON object provides a structured representation of the extracted data.  Many data points within the "Performance Trends", "Ratios", and "Peer Comparison" sections require further parsing of tables from the provided HTML.  The structure is provided to show how the data would be organized; the actual numerical values need to be extracted using appropriate HTML parsing techniques.  Libraries like Beautiful Soup in Python could be used for this task.
