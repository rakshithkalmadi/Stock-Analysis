| Quarter      | Revenue (₹) | Expenditure (₹) | Profit After Tax (₹) | EPS (₹) |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Q2 FY25 (Sep) | 637,458     | 406,922          | 183,407                | 11.27    |

**Analysis:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, but generally remains relatively stable. Profit after tax shows significant variation across quarters, requiring further investigation into the underlying causes.  EPS also reflects this volatility.  A deeper dive into the financial statements is needed for a complete understanding.

**4. Corporate Actions and Announcements:**

OIL has declared several interim and final dividends in the past year, along with a bonus issue (1:2).  Recent announcements include updates on share certificates and changes in key personnel.  These announcements do not appear to have significantly impacted the stock price in the short term.  The upcoming board meeting on November 5th, 2024, to discuss Q3 FY25 results and dividend is a key event to watch.

**5. Shareholding Patterns:**

| Quarter      | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Shares held by Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| 30-Sep-2024  | 56.66                        | 43.34      | 0.00                           | 100.00    |
| 30-Jun-2024  | 56.66                        | 43.34      | 0.00                           | 100.00    |
| 31-Mar-2024  | 56.66                        | 43.34      | 0.00                           | 100.00    |
| 31-Dec-2023  | 56.66                        | 43.34      | 0.00                           | 100.00    |

**Analysis:**  Promoter and public shareholding have remained remarkably stable over the past year, indicating a lack of significant changes in ownership structure.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The CM Annual Volatility of 53.3% further confirms this.  The low market depth adds to the risk, making it challenging to execute large trades without significantly impacting the price.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards higher risk due to volatility and low liquidity.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent promoter holding.
* Dividend payouts.
* Strong position in the energy sector.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility.
* Low market liquidity.
* Inconsistent financial performance (requires further investigation).
* Dependence on global oil prices.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The current price movement is negative, and low liquidity increases the risk of further short-term losses.  Waiting for clearer market signals is advisable.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The medium-term outlook depends on the upcoming Q3 FY25 results and the overall performance of the oil and gas sector.  Further analysis of the financial statements is crucial.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold/Consider Buy (with caution).**  The long-term prospects depend on the company's ability to navigate the challenges in the energy sector and maintain consistent financial performance.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign.  However, the high volatility remains a concern.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10): 6.0**

* Financial Health: 6/10 (Inconsistent profitability needs further investigation)
* Market Performance: 5/10 (High volatility, negative recent performance)

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

OIL presents a mixed investment picture. While the company benefits from a strong sector position and consistent dividend payouts, the high volatility and inconsistent financial performance raise concerns.  A thorough review of the financial statements and clarification on data inconsistencies are necessary before making any significant investment decisions.  For now, a "Hold" strategy is recommended across all investment horizons, with a cautious "Consider Buy" for long-term investors after further due diligence.  The upcoming Q3 FY25 results will be crucial in reassessing the stock's prospects.
