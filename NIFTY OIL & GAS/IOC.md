**Key Observations:**  Shareholding patterns remain consistent over the past year, with a stable promoter holding.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The week's high and low prices (₹196.80 and ₹117.35 respectively) indicate significant volatility.  The CM Annual Volatility of 38.02% further confirms this high risk profile.  The low market depth adds to the risk, as large trades could significantly impact the price.  The risk-reward profile appears unfavorable given the recent decline in profitability and high volatility.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Strong brand recognition and established market position in India's energy sector.
* Consistent promoter holding, indicating confidence in the company's long-term prospects.
* History of dividend payouts.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and low market depth.
* Recent decline in profitability and extremely low profit in the latest quarter.
* Dependence on fluctuating global crude oil prices.
* Potential regulatory changes in the energy sector.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The recent price drop, low profitability, and high volatility make a short-term investment risky.  The low market depth increases the risk of significant price swings.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock).**  A medium-term outlook requires monitoring the company's financial performance and industry trends.  If the company can demonstrate improved profitability, a more positive outlook may be warranted.  However, given the current situation, holding is a more prudent strategy than buying.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold (if you have stock).**  IOC's long-term prospects depend on its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain a strong market share.  However, given the current financial performance, a long-term hold is recommended only for investors with a high risk tolerance.
