**3. Final Verdict:**

**Hold.**

**Reasoning:**

While ITC shows a generally positive trend in financial performance with consistent dividend payouts, the significant volatility and the complete absence of promoter holding are major concerns.  The lack of promoter ownership raises questions about long-term strategic direction and potential for significant share price fluctuations.  Further investigation into the reasons for zero promoter holding is crucial before considering a buy recommendation.  Given the current data, a "hold" strategy is the most prudent approach until further information clarifies the shareholding situation and reduces the inherent risk.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, ITC Limited presents a mixed picture.  Positive financial performance and consistent dividends are offset by high volatility and the absence of promoter ownership.  A more thorough investigation is needed before making a definitive investment decision.
