* Established brand in a growing sector.

* High volatility.
* Inconsistent profitability.
* Low market depth (liquidity risk).
* Dependence on the FMCG sector's performance.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price drop and low market depth suggest caution.  Waiting for clearer price momentum is advisable.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The upcoming dividend payout is positive, but the inconsistent financial performance needs further monitoring.  Industry trends and competitive pressures should be considered.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold.**  The company's established brand and strong promoter holding offer some long-term potential, but consistent profitability needs to be demonstrated.
