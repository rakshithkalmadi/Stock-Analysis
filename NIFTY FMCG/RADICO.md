Promoter shareholding has remained relatively stable, with a minor decrease in the latest quarter.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits significant volatility, as evidenced by the wide range between the week's high and low.  The high PE ratio also suggests a degree of risk.  The limited market depth data prevents a thorough assessment of liquidity risk.  The consistent losses in recent quarters represent a significant financial risk.  A more comprehensive risk assessment requires additional data, including beta and standard deviation of returns.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Relatively stable promoter holding.
* Potential for growth in the FMCG sector. (Requires further research to confirm)

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High PE ratio indicating potential overvaluation.
* Significant price volatility.
* Consistent losses over the past five quarters.
* Limited market depth data raises concerns about liquidity.
* Lack of key financial ratios hinders a complete assessment.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and recent negative financial performance make a short-term investment risky.  The limited market depth adds to this risk.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock).**  While the company has a history of dividend payouts, the consistent losses need to be addressed.  Monitoring future financial reports and industry trends is crucial.  Consider selling if the negative trend continues.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  The fundamental financial weakness outweighs the potential long-term growth in the FMCG sector.  Further investigation into the reasons for the consistent losses is necessary before considering a long-term investment.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10): 4.5**

* Financial Health: 2/10 (Consistent losses)
* Market Performance: 3/10 (Volatility, negative PChange)
* Volatility and Risk: 3/10 (High volatility, limited market depth data)
* Corporate Actions & Governance: 5/10 (Consistent dividends, but limited information on governance)

**Analysis Score (out of 10): 7**

* Completeness and Utilization of Data: 8/10 (Most data used, but some crucial ratios missing)

* Professional Formatting: 8/10 (Well-structured report)


**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the available data, Radico Khaitan Limited presents a high-risk investment.  The consistent losses and high volatility outweigh the advantages of dividend payouts and stable promoter holding.  A "Don't Buy" recommendation is given for both short-term and long-term horizons.  If an investor already holds the stock, a "Hold" recommendation is given for the medium term, contingent on close monitoring of financial performance and industry trends.  Further investigation into the company's financial statements and industry dynamics is strongly recommended before making any investment decision.  The lack of crucial financial ratios significantly limits the scope of this analysis.
