**Note:**  This JSON object represents a significant portion of the extractable data.  Some ratios and metrics require calculation from the provided financial statements (Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss, Cash Flow).  The "..." placeholders indicate where this calculation or further parsing of the HTML tables would be needed to complete the JSON.  The HTML provided is partially structured, making complete automation challenging without more sophisticated HTML parsing and table extraction techniques.  The "Loading peers table..." indicates that peer comparison data was not yet loaded when the HTML was captured.
