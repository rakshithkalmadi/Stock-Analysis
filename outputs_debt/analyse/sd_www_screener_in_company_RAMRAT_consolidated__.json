**Note:**  This JSON object represents a significant portion of the data.  However, much of the quantitative data resides within HTML tables.  To complete the JSON,  a robust HTML table parsing and extraction mechanism would be needed to populate the missing values in the "Performance Trends" and "Ratios" sections.  The code would need to iterate through the tables, identify headers, and extract the corresponding numerical values.  Libraries like Beautiful Soup in Python are well-suited for this task.
