**Note:**  This JSON representation is a partial extraction.  Many data points within the tables (Quarterly Results, Annual Results, Balance Sheet, Cash Flows, Ratios, Shareholding Pattern) are represented only partially due to the complexity of extracting tabular data from HTML.  A robust HTML parsing library and potentially some data cleaning/transformation would be needed to fully populate these sections.  The `null` values indicate data points that were not explicitly found in the provided HTML snippet but could be derived from the tables if fully parsed.  The units (Rs. Crores, %) are included where explicitly stated in the HTML.  Further processing would be needed to standardize units and data types.
