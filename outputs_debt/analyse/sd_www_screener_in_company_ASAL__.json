**Note:**  This JSON representation is a best effort based on the provided HTML snippet.  Some fields like ROE, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, and several other ratios are missing from the HTML and therefore marked as "Information not explicitly available".  A complete and robust solution would require a more sophisticated HTML parser and potentially access to additional data sources to fill in these gaps.  The quarterly and annual financial data is partially populated to illustrate the structure; a full extraction would include all available data points.  Error handling and more robust data validation would also be necessary in a production-ready system.
