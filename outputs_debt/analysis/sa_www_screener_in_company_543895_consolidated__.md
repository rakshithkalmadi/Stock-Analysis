* **Volatile ROCE:**  The significant fluctuation in ROCE over the past three years raises concerns about the sustainability of profitability.
* **Limited Data:**  Absence of crucial metrics like Price-to-Book, Market Cap/Sales, and EV/EBITDA hinders a complete valuation.

**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Compared to its peers, Exhicon Events has a relatively lower P/E ratio and higher ROCE.  However, the peer group is diverse, and direct comparison is difficult without more standardized metrics.  The median P/E of peers is significantly higher (32.44 vs 20.57), suggesting Exhicon might be undervalued relative to its peers, but this needs further investigation.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

The limited available data makes a precise valuation challenging.  The P/E ratio of 20.6 is relatively low compared to some peers, suggesting potential undervaluation. However, the lack of Price-to-Book and other key valuation metrics prevents a definitive conclusion.  The high growth rates in sales and profit suggest future potential, but the deteriorating liquidity ratios are a significant concern.


**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

* **Short-term (3-6 months):** HOLD.  The recent stock price decline and concerns about liquidity warrant a cautious approach in the short term.  **Confidence Level: Medium.**  Further monitoring of debtor days and working capital days is crucial.

* **Medium-term (6-12 months):** BUY.  If the company addresses its liquidity issues and maintains its strong revenue growth, the stock has significant upside potential.  **Confidence Level: Medium.** This recommendation hinges on improved cash flow management.

* **Long-term (1+ years):** BUY.  The company's strong growth potential and near-zero debt position make it an attractive long-term investment.  **Confidence Level: Medium.**  However, continued monitoring of financial ratios and operational efficiency is essential.


**9. Final Verdict:**

Exhicon Events Media Solutions Ltd. presents a mixed investment picture.  While the company demonstrates impressive revenue and profit growth, concerns remain regarding its deteriorating liquidity ratios and volatile ROCE.  The relatively low P/E ratio suggests potential undervaluation, but a more comprehensive valuation is needed.  Investors should closely monitor the company's progress in addressing its liquidity challenges and maintaining its strong revenue growth before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis is needed to improve confidence levels, particularly by obtaining missing data points and conducting a more in-depth industry comparison.
