## Nisus Finance Services Co Ltd: Comprehensive Financial Analysis

**1. Company Overview:**

Nisus Finance Services Co Ltd, incorporated in 2013, operates in the Finance & Investments industry within the broader Finance sector.  Its business model centers around providing financial services such as Transaction Advisory Services, Fund and Asset Management, Private Equity and Venture Debt, and Capital Solutions primarily to corporate clients.  The company's market position is noted as being part of the BSE SME IPO, suggesting a relatively smaller market capitalization compared to established players.  Recent announcements highlight the addition of Vivek Oberoi as a partner to their High Yield Growth Fund, potentially signaling expansion efforts.

**2. Key Financial Metrics:**

* **Current Price:** ₹ 318
* **P/E Ratio:** 33.2 (High compared to industry peers)
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 110% (Extremely high, warrants further investigation)
* **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** 102% (Extremely high, warrants further investigation)
* **Dividend Yield:** 0.00%
* **Market Capitalization:** ₹ 759 Cr.
* **Book Value:** Not provided.  This is a critical missing data point.
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**  Cannot be calculated without complete balance sheet data for all years.  This is a significant gap in the provided data.


**3. Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

* **Exceptional profitability:** Extremely high ROE and ROCE figures suggest strong operational efficiency and high profitability.  The recent quarterly results show exceptionally high operating profit margins (76.88%).
* **Significant revenue growth:**  The company has demonstrated substantial revenue and profit growth in recent years, particularly in the TTM period (273% sales growth, 663% profit growth).
* **High Promoter Holding:**  73.22% promoter holding indicates strong management control and alignment of interests.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Data Gaps:** The absence of crucial data points like Book Value and a complete Debt-to-Equity ratio calculation significantly limits the analysis.  The lack of 10-year and 5-year CAGR data also hinders a complete long-term perspective.
* **High P/E Ratio:** The P/E ratio of 33.2 is considerably higher than the median of its peers, suggesting potential overvaluation.
* **Increasing Debtor Days and Working Capital Days:**  A substantial increase in debtor days (from 3 to 91 days) and working capital days (from 26.8 to 64.4 days) raises concerns about cash flow management and potential credit risk.
* **Limited Historical Data:** The available financial data covers only a short period, making it difficult to assess long-term trends and sustainability.


**4. Performance Trends:**

The company exhibits explosive growth in the last fiscal year (Mar 2024), with significant increases in sales, operating profit, and net profit.  However, the preceding years show a more moderate growth trajectory.  The extremely high OPM% in the June 2024 quarter (76.88%) needs further investigation to determine its sustainability.  The provided cash flow data shows some volatility, but overall, the company seems to have generated positive net cash flow in recent years.  The lack of complete balance sheet data prevents a thorough assessment of balance sheet health.

**5. Growth Metrics:**

* **Sales CAGR:**  Only 3-year and TTM data are available, showing significant growth (96% and 273%, respectively).  Long-term CAGR is unavailable.
* **Profit CAGR:** Similar to sales, only 3-year and TTM data are available, showing substantial growth (130% and 663%, respectively). Long-term CAGR is unavailable.
* **Stock Price CAGR:** No data available.
* **ROE:**  While the current ROE is exceptionally high (110%), long-term trends (10-year, 5-year) are missing, preventing a proper assessment of its sustainability.  The 3-year ROE is reported as 77.9% in the "OtherInsights" section, which is still very high.

**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Nisus Finance's P/E ratio (33.2) is significantly higher than the median P/E ratio of its peers (25.6).  Its market capitalization is also much smaller.  While its ROE and ROCE are exceptionally high compared to peers, the limited data prevents a robust comparison.  The high growth rates are noteworthy, but their sustainability needs further investigation.

**7. Stock Valuation:**

Given the high P/E ratio and the lack of crucial data (Book Value), a definitive valuation is impossible.  The extremely high ROE and ROCE suggest strong profitability, but the sustainability of these figures and the high growth rates needs to be confirmed with more data and a deeper understanding of the business model.  The current valuation appears potentially overvalued based on the P/E ratio comparison to peers, but this conclusion is tentative due to data limitations.

**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

Due to significant data gaps, assigning high-confidence recommendations is not possible.  Further investigation is required to obtain complete financial statements and understand the drivers of the exceptionally high profitability and growth.

* **Short-term (3-6 months):**  **Neutral**.  Confidence Level: **Low**.  Reasoning:  The high growth rates and profitability are promising, but the lack of data and the high P/E ratio create uncertainty.  Further analysis is needed to assess short-term risks and opportunities.

* **Medium-term (6-12 months):**  **Neutral**. Confidence Level: **Low**. Reasoning: Similar to the short-term outlook, the lack of data prevents a confident assessment of medium-term prospects.

* **Long-term (1+ years):**  **Neutral**. Confidence Level: **Low**. Reasoning:  The company's growth potential is evident, but the sustainability of its high profitability and the absence of long-term data make a long-term recommendation premature.


**9. Final Verdict:**

Nisus Finance Services Co Ltd shows signs of impressive growth and profitability, but the analysis is severely hampered by significant data gaps.  The high P/E ratio relative to peers raises concerns about potential overvaluation.  Before making any investment decisions, investors must obtain complete financial statements, including a full balance sheet, to assess the company's financial health, debt levels, and the sustainability of its high growth rates.  Further investigation into the drivers of the exceptionally high ROE and ROCE is crucial.  Until these data gaps are addressed, a confident investment recommendation cannot be made.
