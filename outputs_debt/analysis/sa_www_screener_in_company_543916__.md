## Hemant Surgical Industries Ltd: Comprehensive Financial Analysis

**1. Company Overview:**

Hemant Surgical Industries Ltd (HSIL), incorporated in 1989, operates in the Healthcare sector, specifically the Medical Equipment & Supplies industry.  Its business model encompasses importing, manufacturing, and marketing medical disposables, surgical equipment, and pharmaceutical products.  This includes dialysis equipment, renal care products, oxygen concentrators, and the manufacturing of nebulizers under its AERO brand.  HSIL also refurbishes used dialysis machines. The company holds ISO 9001:2015, ISO 13485:2016 certifications and is CDSCO compliant.  Its market position appears to be that of a smaller player compared to its peers, based on market capitalization.


**2. Key Financial Metrics:**

* **Market Cap:** ₹ 132 Cr.
* **Current Price:** ₹ 127
* **High/Low (52-week):** ₹ 225 / ₹ 115
* **P/E Ratio:** 14.6
* **Book Value:** ₹ 55.6
* **Dividend Yield:** 0.00%
* **ROCE:** 29.8%
* **ROE:** 25.0%
* **Face Value:** ₹ 10.0


**3. Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

* **High ROCE and ROE:**  Indicative of efficient capital utilization and profitability.
* **Strong Profit Growth (5-year CAGR):**  54% profit growth over the past five years demonstrates significant expansion.
* **Relatively Low P/E Ratio:** Compared to industry peers (see below), the P/E ratio suggests potential undervaluation.


**Weaknesses:**

* **No Dividend Payout:**  Absence of dividend payments might deter some income-seeking investors.
* **High Reliance on Other Income:**  Quarterly results show significant contributions from other income, which may not be sustainable.
* **Fluctuating Operating Profit Margins:** OPM fluctuates significantly across quarters, indicating potential operational inconsistencies.
* **Missing Data:**  Significant financial data (sales and margin trends, liquidity ratios, detailed ROCE trends) is missing or requires further processing from the provided HTML tables.  This limits the depth of the analysis.
* **Working Capital Issues:** Increased working capital days suggest potential inefficiencies in managing inventory and receivables.
* **Small Market Cap:**  Being a smaller player exposes the company to greater risk compared to larger, more established competitors.


**4. Performance Trends:**

The quarterly results show fluctuating sales and profitability. While Mar 2023 showed strong performance, subsequent quarters exhibit lower profitability.  The significant variation in operating profit margins (OPM) across quarters raises concerns about operational consistency and predictability.  The lack of detailed annual results and balance sheet data prevents a comprehensive assessment of financial health and operational efficiency.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind these fluctuations.


**5. Growth Metrics:**

* **Sales CAGR:**  Incomplete data (10-year, 5-year, 3-year data missing). TTM: 1%
* **Profit CAGR:** Incomplete data (10-year data missing). 5-year: 54%; 3-year: 93%; TTM: -2%
* **Stock Price CAGR:** Incomplete data (10-year, 5-year, 3-year data missing). 1-year: -24%
* **ROE:** Incomplete data (10-year data missing). 5-year: 28%; 3-year: 32%; Last Year: 25%

The available growth data shows impressive profit growth in the past 3 and 5 years, but the recent TTM figures indicate a slowdown.  The significant negative stock price CAGR over the last year is a major concern.


**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Compared to its peers, HSIL has a significantly lower market capitalization and a much lower P/E ratio.  Its ROCE is relatively high compared to the median, suggesting efficient capital utilization. However, the other metrics (CMP, NP Qtr, Sales Qtr) are significantly lower, reflecting its smaller scale.  The peer comparison highlights HSIL's position as a smaller player in a market dominated by larger companies.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

Based on the limited data, the low P/E ratio (14.6) compared to industry peers suggests potential undervaluation. However, the lack of comprehensive data, particularly regarding future growth prospects, makes a definitive valuation judgment difficult.  Further analysis is needed to assess the Price-to-Book ratio and growth potential accurately.


**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

Due to the incomplete data and significant fluctuations in performance, assigning high-confidence recommendations is not possible at this time.  Further investigation is required to obtain missing financial data and understand the drivers of the observed volatility.

**Short-term (3-6 months):**  Neutral.  Confidence Level: Low.  Reasoning:  The recent performance has been mixed, and the lack of data prevents a confident prediction.

**Medium-term (6-12 months):**  Neutral to cautiously optimistic. Confidence Level: Low. Reasoning:  The company's historical growth is impressive, but the recent slowdown and missing data require further investigation before a confident outlook can be formed.

**Long-term (1+ years):**  Potentially positive, but requires further due diligence. Confidence Level: Low. Reasoning:  The high ROCE and ROE suggest potential for long-term growth, but the company's small size and dependence on other income present significant risks.


**9. Final Verdict:**

Hemant Surgical Industries Ltd shows potential based on its historical growth and relatively high ROCE and ROE. However, the significant gaps in the provided data, the recent slowdown in growth, and the fluctuating profitability make it impossible to provide high-confidence recommendations.  Before making any investment decisions, investors should conduct thorough due diligence, including obtaining complete financial statements and analyzing the drivers of the observed volatility.  The missing data significantly limits the reliability of this analysis, and further investigation is crucial before forming a definitive opinion on the stock's investment potential.
