**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

MapmyIndia's P/E ratio (67.2) is significantly higher than the median P/E of its peers (43.44).  Its ROCE (26.2%) is also below the median of its peers (17.45), although it is still a healthy figure.  Its market capitalization is considerably smaller than its peers.  This comparison suggests that MapmyIndia might be overvalued relative to its peers, especially considering its slower recent growth.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

Based on the high P/E ratio (67.2), high Price-to-Book ratio (12.4), and slowing growth rate, MapmyIndia appears to be potentially overvalued at its current price.  While the company demonstrates strong fundamentals in terms of ROE and ROCE, the market seems to be pricing in significantly higher future growth than what is currently evident.


**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

* **Short-term (3-6 months):** Hold or cautiously sell.  The recent decline in stock price and slowing growth warrant caution.  Confidence Level: **Medium** (Based on the recent negative trend and high valuation).

* **Medium-term (6-12 months):** Hold.  The company's long-term prospects remain positive, but further performance monitoring is needed. Confidence Level: **Medium** (Dependent on future performance and market sentiment).

* **Long-term (1+ years):**  Hold or cautiously buy on dips.  The company operates in a high-growth sector, and its strong fundamentals could lead to future growth.  However, the current valuation needs to be considered. Confidence Level: **Medium** (Long-term growth potential is present, but valuation risk remains).


**9. Final Verdict:**

C.E. Info Systems Ltd (MapmyIndia) operates in a promising sector with strong long-term potential.  However, the current stock price appears to be overvalued relative to its peers and recent performance.  Investors should proceed with caution, closely monitoring the company's financial performance and market sentiment.  A more detailed analysis incorporating missing data (Debt-to-Equity ratio, complete ROE history) and a deeper dive into the company's competitive landscape and future growth strategies is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current recommendations are based on the limited data provided and should be considered preliminary.
