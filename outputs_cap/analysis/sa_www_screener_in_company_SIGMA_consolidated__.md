* **P/E Ratio:** 19.3
* **ROE:** 46.8%
* **ROCE:** 52.5%
* **Dividend Yield:** 0.15%
* **Market Capitalization:** ₹ 346 Cr.
* **Book Value:** ₹ 36.8


**3. Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

* **High ROCE and ROE:**  The exceptionally high ROCE (52.5%) and ROE (46.8%) indicate strong profitability and efficient capital utilization. This suggests a potentially well-managed and profitable business model.
* **Strong Profit Growth (Historical):**  The 3-year compounded profit growth of 71% demonstrates significant historical growth.
* **High Promoter Holding:** 73.22% promoter holding suggests strong management alignment and potentially less susceptibility to short-term market pressures.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Declining Sales Growth (Recent):** While historical sales growth is impressive, the TTM sales growth of 8% shows a significant slowdown.
* **Increasing Debtor Days:** The increase in debtor days (from 48.8 to 81.9 days) indicates potential issues with collecting payments from clients, impacting cash flow.
* **Increasing Working Capital Days:**  The rise in working capital days (from 21.9 to 60.3 days) further points to potential inefficiencies in managing working capital.
* **High Price-to-Book Ratio:** The stock is trading at 9.15 times its book value (337/36.8), suggesting it might be overvalued based solely on this metric.  Further analysis is needed.
* **Lack of Information:**  The absence of crucial data points like debt-to-equity ratio, inventory days, days payable, and cash conversion cycle hinders a complete assessment of financial health.


**4. Performance Trends:**

* **Quarterly Results:** Show fluctuating sales and profits, indicating some seasonality or project-based revenue streams.  Operating profit margins (OPM) also fluctuate, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining consistent profitability.
* **Annual Results:** Demonstrate a strong upward trend in sales and profits over the past few years, although growth has slowed recently.
* **Balance Sheet Health:** Cannot be fully assessed due to missing data (debt-to-equity ratio).
* **Cash Flow Trends:** Cannot be assessed due to missing cash flow data.
* **Financial Ratios:** ROCE shows a generally strong performance, but the increasing debtor and working capital days raise concerns about operational efficiency and cash flow management.


**5. Growth Metrics:**

* **Sales CAGR (3 Years):** 45%
* **Sales CAGR (TTM):** 8%
* **Profit CAGR (3 Years):** 71%
* **Profit CAGR (TTM):** 41%
* **Stock Price CAGR (3 Years):** 25%
* **Stock Price CAGR (1 Year):** -26%
* **ROE:** Requires data for 10, 5, and 3 years to calculate accurately.  The provided 3-year ROE is 41.2%, which is strong but needs further context.


**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Sigma Solve's P/E ratio (19.3) is significantly lower than the median P/E of its peers (43.44).  However, its market capitalization is also much smaller.  Its ROCE (52.5%) is considerably higher than the median (17.45), highlighting its superior profitability relative to its peers.  A direct comparison is difficult due to the significant size difference and the lack of consistent comparable metrics across all peers.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

The stock's valuation is complex. While the low P/E ratio compared to peers might suggest undervaluation, the high price-to-book ratio and recent slowdown in growth raise concerns.  A more detailed valuation would require discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which is not possible with the limited data provided.  The current information suggests a potential overvaluation based on the price-to-book ratio, but this needs further investigation.


**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

* **Short-term (3-6 months):** **Hold**.  The recent slowdown in growth and increasing debtor days warrant caution.  Confidence Level: **Medium**.
* **Medium-term (6-12 months):** **Hold/Slight Buy**.  If the company addresses the working capital issues and demonstrates renewed sales growth, a slight buy could be considered.  Confidence Level: **Medium**.
* **Long-term (1+ years):** **Hold/Buy (Conditional)**.  The long-term potential is promising given the high ROCE and ROE, but hinges on the company's ability to sustain profitability and improve operational efficiency.  A buy is conditional on improved cash flow management and sustained growth. Confidence Level: **Medium**.


**9. Final Verdict:**

Sigma Solve Ltd. presents a mixed picture.  While its historical financial performance is impressive, characterized by high profitability and strong growth, recent trends indicate a slowdown and potential operational inefficiencies.  The lack of crucial financial data limits a comprehensive assessment.  Investors should closely monitor the company's progress in addressing its working capital issues and improving its sales growth trajectory before making any significant investment decisions.  Further investigation into the company's market position and competitive landscape is crucial.  The current valuation is uncertain, requiring more detailed analysis.  The recommendations are based on the available data and should be considered with caution.  Additional information, particularly regarding debt levels and cash flow statements, is needed to increase confidence levels.
