Ganesh Housing Corporation Ltd (GHCL), established in 1991, operates in the Indian Realty sector, specifically focusing on residential and commercial real estate development and infrastructure projects.  Based in Gujarat, the company boasts ISO certifications and KPMG endorsement, signifying a commitment to quality and standards.  GHCL has a proven track record, having sold over 22 million sq ft of real estate and having another 35 million sq ft under development.

**2. Key Financial Metrics:**

* **Market Cap:** ₹ 9,908 Cr.
* **Current Price:** ₹ 1,188
* **High/Low (52-week):** ₹ 1,340 / ₹ 379
* **P/E Ratio:** 20.4
* **Book Value:** ₹ 208
* **Dividend Yield:** 0.93%
* **ROCE:** 45.0% (Note: This seems unusually high and requires further investigation, potentially looking at the calculation methodology and consistency over time)
* **ROE:** 41.6% (Similar to ROCE, this high value needs further scrutiny for consistency and accuracy)
* **Face Value:** ₹ 10.0


**3. Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

* **High ROCE and ROE:**  While needing further validation, exceptionally high ROCE and ROE suggest strong profitability and efficient capital utilization.
* **Significant Growth:**  Impressive sales and profit CAGR figures (especially over 3 and 5 years) point to robust growth.
* **Debt Reduction:** The provided insights mention a significant reduction in debt, improving the company's financial health.
* **Improved Debtor Days:**  A decrease in debtor days indicates better collection efficiency.


**Weaknesses:**

* **High Volatility:** The wide range between the 52-week high and low suggests significant price volatility.
* **Data Reliability:** The provided data contains inconsistencies and unusually high ROCE and ROE figures that require further investigation and external validation from reliable financial sources.
* **Small Market Cap:** Being part of the microcap segment exposes the company to higher risk and potentially lower liquidity.
* **Limited Peer Data:** The peer comparison data is limited and may not be fully representative of the competitive landscape.


**4. Performance Trends:**

The quarterly and annual results show significant fluctuations in sales, operating profit, and net profit.  While there are periods of strong growth, there are also periods of decline.  The OPM% also fluctuates considerably, indicating variability in operational efficiency.  The provided liquidity ratios (Debtor Days, Inventory Days, etc.) show inconsistencies and require further analysis to understand the working capital management.  A detailed analysis of cash flow statements is needed to fully assess the company's financial health.  The high variability in tax percentages also needs clarification.


**5. Growth Metrics:**

The provided growth metrics are impressive, particularly the short-term CAGRs. However, the long-term CAGRs are more moderate.  The significant jump in growth rates in recent years needs to be examined for sustainability.  A detailed analysis of the drivers of this growth is crucial.  The ROE figures also need verification due to their unusually high values.


**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

The peer comparison shows that GHCL's P/E ratio is significantly lower than many of its peers. However, the market capitalization is also much smaller.  A more in-depth comparison using standardized financial ratios and considering company size and stage of development is necessary.  The median values provided are not very informative without context on how they were calculated and what they represent.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

Based on the limited and potentially unreliable data, a definitive valuation is impossible.  The low P/E ratio compared to peers *could* suggest undervaluation, but this needs to be considered in light of the company's smaller size and higher risk profile.  The Price-to-Book ratio (1,188/208 = 5.7) is relatively high, suggesting potential overvaluation.  A thorough valuation using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and comparable company analysis with verified data is required.


**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

Due to the inconsistencies and potential unreliability of the provided data, assigning concrete recommendations with high confidence is not possible.  Further investigation is needed to verify the financial data and perform a robust valuation.  Until this is done, any recommendation would be highly speculative.


**9. Final Verdict:**

The provided data presents a mixed picture of Ganesh Housing Corporation Ltd.  While the company shows signs of strong growth and profitability in certain periods, the data inconsistencies, high volatility, and limited peer comparison make a conclusive assessment impossible.  Further investigation is crucial before making any investment decisions.  This includes verifying the financial data from reliable sources, performing a thorough valuation, and conducting a more comprehensive peer comparison.  Only after this rigorous analysis can a well-informed investment recommendation be made.
