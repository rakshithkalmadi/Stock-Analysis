**5. Shareholding Patterns:**

| Quarter      | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Shares held by Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-----------|

Promoter shareholding has shown a slight downward trend over the past year, while public shareholding has correspondingly increased. This trend is not alarming but warrants monitoring.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

Based on the week's high and low (₹602.55 and ₹572 respectively), the stock exhibits moderate short-term volatility.  The CM Daily and Annual Volatility (2.17% and 41.46% respectively) further support this assessment.  However, a longer historical price data is needed for a more comprehensive volatility analysis.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards risk due to the consistent losses and moderate volatility.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Relatively high delivery percentage suggests some underlying institutional support.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* Consistent losses over the past five quarters.
* Missing key financial ratios prevent a thorough fundamental analysis.
* Moderate to high volatility.
* Insufficient market depth data hinders a complete risk assessment.
* Declining promoter holding.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The recent price drop and inconsistent financial performance make a short-term investment risky.  The pre-open activity suggests some potential upward movement, but the overall trend is negative.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  The medium-term outlook depends heavily on improved financial performance and a clearer strategic direction from the company.  Further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of dividend payouts given the current financial situation.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  The consistent losses and lack of clear positive growth trends make a long-term investment in BSOFT currently unattractive.  Significant improvement in fundamentals is needed before considering a long-term position.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10): 4.5**

* **Financial Health (out of 10): 3** (Consistent losses significantly impact this score.)
* **Market Performance (out of 10): 4** (Moderate volatility and recent price decline.)

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the analysis of the provided data, Birlasoft Limited (BSOFT) is not recommended for investment in the short-term or long-term.  A medium-term "Hold" recommendation is given only for existing investors, contingent upon significant improvement in the company's financial performance and a clearer strategic direction.  The lack of crucial financial ratios and incomplete market depth data limits the confidence in this assessment.  Further research is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
