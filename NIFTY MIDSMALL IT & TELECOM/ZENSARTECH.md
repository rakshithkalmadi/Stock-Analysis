**Key Financial Ratios:**  These ratios require more detailed financial statements for accurate calculation.  The provided data only allows for a limited assessment.

**4. Corporate Actions and Announcements:**

Zensar Technologies has a history of consistent dividend payouts, both interim and final, over the past several years.  Recent announcements include several regarding loss/duplicate share certificates, alteration of capital, and shareholder meetings.  These announcements do not appear to significantly impact the short-term stock price, but further investigation is needed to assess their long-term implications.

**5. Shareholding Patterns:**

| Quarter      | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------|-----------|
| 30-Sep-2023  | 49.20                        | 50.80      | 0.00               | 100.00    |
| 31-Dec-2023  | 49.20                        | 50.80      | 0.00               | 100.00    |
| 31-Mar-2024  | 49.17                        | 50.83      | 0.00               | 100.00    |

| 30-Sep-2024  | 49.13                        | 50.87      | 0.00               | 100.00    |

Promoter holding has shown a slight decrease over the past year, while public holding has correspondingly increased. This is a minor shift and doesn't indicate a significant concern.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits significant volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The CM Annual Volatility of 44.71% further confirms this high risk profile.  The low market depth adds to the risk, as it may be difficult to buy or sell large quantities without significantly impacting the price.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Relatively stable financial performance (though recent quarters show some decline).


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and risk.
* Low market depth, implying low liquidity.
* Recent decline in PAT and EPS needs further investigation.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price decline and low market depth suggest caution.  Waiting for clearer price direction is advisable.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The medium-term outlook depends on the company's ability to address the decline in profitability observed in the last two quarters and the overall market conditions.  Further analysis of the company's strategy and competitive landscape is needed.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy (at current price).** While the company has a history of dividend payouts, the recent financial performance decline and high volatility make it a risky long-term investment at the current price.  A more thorough fundamental analysis is required before considering a long-term investment.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10): 6.0**

* Financial Health: 6/10 (Consistent profitability but recent decline is concerning)
* Market Performance: 5/10 (High volatility, recent price drop)
* Volatility and Risk: 4/10 (High volatility, low liquidity)
* Corporate Actions & Governance: 7/10 (Consistent dividends, but some negative announcements)

**Analysis Score (out of 10): 7.5**

* Completeness and Data Utilization: 8/10 (Most data used effectively)
* Accuracy and Clarity: 7/10 (Analysis is clear but limited by data availability)
* Professional Formatting: 8/10 (Report is well-structured and easy to read)


**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the available data, ZENSARTECH presents a mixed picture.  While the company has a history of dividend payments and relatively stable financial performance (until recently), the high volatility, low liquidity, and recent decline in profitability raise significant concerns.  Therefore, a "Hold" recommendation is given for the short and medium term, pending further investigation into the reasons for the recent financial performance decline.  A "Don't Buy" recommendation is given for the long term at the current price.  More detailed financial statements and industry analysis are crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.
