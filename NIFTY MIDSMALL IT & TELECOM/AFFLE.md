The provided data lacks sufficient detail for a complete ratio analysis.

**4. Corporate Actions and Announcements:**

* **Face Value Split:** A face value split from ₹10 to ₹2 per share occurred on October 7, 2021.
* **Recent Announcements:** Numerous announcements related to alterations of capital, fund raising, ESOPs, and analyst meetings have been made in December 2024.  These require further investigation to assess their impact on the stock price.

**5. Shareholding Patterns:**

| Date        | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Shares held by Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|-------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| 22-Nov-2023 | 56.93                        | 43.00      | 0.07                             | 100.00    |

**Analysis:** Promoter holding has slightly decreased over the past year, while public holding has increased correspondingly. This warrants further investigation to understand the reasons behind this shift.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The week's high and low prices (₹1,884 and ₹998.20 respectively) indicate significant price volatility. The CM Annual Volatility of 39.74% further confirms this high volatility.  The low market depth adds to the risk profile, as large trades could significantly impact the price.  The risk-reward profile is currently high risk due to volatility and low liquidity.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Growing revenue and profit after tax (though requiring further ratio analysis for confirmation).
* Positive pre-open activity on December 20, 2024.
* Relatively high promoter holding (though decreasing).

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High price volatility.
* Low market depth, implying low liquidity.
* Decreasing promoter holding.
* High PE ratio compared to the sector.
* Insufficient data for a thorough fundamental analysis.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price drop and low market depth create uncertainty.  Monitoring price action and volume is crucial.  A break above ₹1,800 could signal a short-term buy opportunity, while a break below ₹1,700 could trigger a sell signal.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Don't Buy.**  While the financial performance shows some positive trends, the high volatility and low liquidity present significant risk.  Further investigation into the recent corporate announcements is needed before considering a medium-term investment.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  The lack of sufficient data for a comprehensive fundamental analysis, coupled with the high volatility and uncertainty surrounding recent announcements, makes a long-term investment currently inadvisable.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10): 5.5**

* Financial Health: 6/10 (Positive revenue and profit trends, but needs more ratio analysis)
* Market Performance: 4/10 (High volatility, negative daily performance, low market depth)
* Volatility and Risk: 3/10 (High volatility, low liquidity)
* Corporate Actions & Governance: 7/10 (Face value split, but recent announcements need further review)
* Shareholding Patterns: 6/10 (Relatively high promoter holding, but decreasing)

**Analysis Score (out of 10): 7/10**

* Completeness and Utilization of Data: 8/10 (Most data used, but some ratios are missing)
* Accuracy and Clarity of Analysis: 7/10 (Analysis is clear, but some conclusions are tentative due to data limitations)
* Professional Formatting: 8/10 (Report is well-structured and easy to read)


**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the available data, AFFLE presents a high-risk, high-reward profile.  The short-term outlook is uncertain, with a "Hold" recommendation pending further price action.  However, due to high volatility, low liquidity, and the need for more in-depth fundamental analysis,  "Don't Buy" recommendations are given for both medium-term and long-term investment horizons.  Further investigation into the recent corporate announcements and a more comprehensive financial analysis are strongly recommended before considering any investment in AFFLE.
