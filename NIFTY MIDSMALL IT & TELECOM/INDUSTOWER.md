|-----------------|---------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|-------|
| 31-Dec-2023     | 69.00%                     | 30.96% | 0.04%                          | 100.00%|
| 31-Mar-2024     | 69.00%                     | 30.97% | 0.04%                          | 100.00%|

| 30-Sep-2024     | 53.01%                     | 46.98% | 0.01%                          | 100.00%|

**Analysis:** A significant decrease in promoter holding from 69% to 53% between March and September 2024 is a major red flag and warrants further investigation.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock has shown significant volatility, as evidenced by the week high and low. The CM Annual Volatility of 46.81% indicates high risk. The declining financial performance further increases the risk profile.  The low market depth adds to the risk, making it difficult to buy or sell large quantities without significantly impacting the price.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Strong sector positioning in a growing telecom market.
* History of paying dividends (though recent payouts are not consistent).

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* Declining revenue, profit, and EPS over the past five quarters.
* Significant drop in promoter holding.
* High volatility and risk.
* Low market depth and liquidity.
* Recent negative announcements and potential legal issues.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The current price momentum is negative, volatility is high, and the market depth is poor.  The recent decline in promoter holding adds to the risk.
* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  The medium-term outlook depends heavily on the company's ability to reverse the declining financial trends and address the concerns raised by the drop in promoter holding.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decline is crucial.
* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.** The fundamental weaknesses, coupled with the high volatility and uncertainty surrounding the company's future, make a long-term investment risky.
