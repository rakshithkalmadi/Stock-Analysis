**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits significant volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The CM Daily and Annual Volatility (1.72% and 32.86% respectively) further confirms this.  The low delivery percentage also suggests a higher risk profile due to speculative trading.  A more detailed risk assessment requires analyzing historical price data and applying relevant risk metrics.


**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* **Consistent Dividend Payments:**  A history of dividend payments indicates a commitment to shareholder returns.
* **Pharmaceutical Sector Growth:** The pharmaceutical sector generally experiences consistent growth, offering long-term potential.
* **Relatively Stable Shareholding:** The consistent shareholding pattern suggests stability in the company's ownership structure.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* **High Volatility:** The stock's price fluctuates significantly, posing substantial risk to short-term investors.
* **Limited Market Depth Data:** The lack of comprehensive market depth information hinders a complete risk assessment.
* **Dependence on External Factors:** The pharmaceutical industry is susceptible to regulatory changes and global economic conditions.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price drop and low delivery percentage suggest caution.  Waiting for clearer market signals is advisable.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The company's financial performance needs further evaluation to assess its medium-term growth potential.  Monitoring upcoming corporate actions and industry trends is crucial.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Hold/Consider Buy (with caution).**  The pharmaceutical sector's long-term growth potential and the company's consistent dividend payments make it a potential long-term investment. However, the high volatility and the need for further fundamental analysis warrant caution.
