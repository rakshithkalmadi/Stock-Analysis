* High volatility and low liquidity increase the risk of significant price swings.

* The impact of announced acquisitions and slump sales needs further analysis.
* Potential regulatory and tax risks are highlighted in the financial statements.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price drop and low market depth suggest caution.  Waiting for clearer short-term price momentum is advisable.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The medium-term outlook depends on the company's ability to address the concerns raised in the Q4 FY24 results and clarify the impact of corporate actions.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decrease in promoter holding is crucial.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold with Caution.** Alkem operates in a growing sector, but the recent volatility and financial performance fluctuations warrant a cautious approach.  Thorough due diligence is necessary before committing to a long-term investment.
