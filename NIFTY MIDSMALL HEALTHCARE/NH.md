* **Dividends:** NH has a history of paying dividends.  A dividend of ₹4 per share was declared with an ex-date of August 2, 2024.
* **Announcements:** Recent announcements include shareholder meetings, an acquisition, and a scheme of arrangement.  These announcements suggest ongoing corporate activity and potential future growth opportunities.  However, the specifics require further analysis to assess their impact on the stock price.

| Quarter      | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Shares held by Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| 30-Sep-2023  | 63.85                       | 35.53      | 0.62                            | 100.00     |

| 30-Sep-2024  | 63.85                       | 35.53      | 0.62                            | 100.00     |

**Analysis:**  Promoter and public shareholding remain relatively stable over the past year, indicating a lack of significant changes in ownership structure.


**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock has shown significant volatility in the past year, as evidenced by the difference between the week high and week low.  The relatively low market depth further contributes to the risk profile.  The high delivery percentage in the recent trading session suggests some underlying strength, but the overall volatility remains a concern.


**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Strong promoter holding.
* Established player in the growing healthcare sector.
* History of dividend payments.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility.
* Inconsistent financial performance (fluctuations in profit after tax and EPS).
* Low market depth increases risk.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price action is slightly positive, but the low market depth and volatility make a "Buy" recommendation risky in the short term.  A "Hold" strategy allows for monitoring of price movements and potential short-term triggers.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The medium-term outlook depends on the successful execution of corporate actions and consistent improvement in financial performance.  Further analysis of the announced acquisition and scheme of arrangement is needed.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold.**  The long-term prospects are tied to the growth of the healthcare sector in India and NH's ability to maintain its market share and improve profitability.  The strong promoter holding is a positive factor.

**Stock Score (out of 10): 6.5**

* Financial Health: 6/10 (Inconsistent profitability)

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**
