Promoter holding remains consistently high at approximately 75%, indicating strong management control.  However, the data only covers a short period.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant difference between the week's high (₹30,521) and low (₹22,000).  The CM Daily Volatility (1.35%) and CM Annual Volatility (25.79%) further confirm this.  The limited market depth adds to the risk, as large trades could significantly impact the price.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards higher risk due to volatility and low liquidity.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* High promoter holding, suggesting strong management control.
* Presence in the NIFTY 500 index.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility.
* Low liquidity.
* Insufficient financial data for a thorough assessment.
* Recent significant price drop.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The recent price drop and high volatility make a short-term investment risky.  The low liquidity adds to the risk of being unable to exit the position quickly.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  A medium-term outlook requires more financial data to assess the company's growth prospects.  The current volatility and lack of liquidity make it a risky investment.  If you already hold the stock, consider holding it only if your risk tolerance is high.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  Long-term investors might consider this stock if they have a high risk tolerance and believe in the long-term growth potential of the pharmaceutical sector in India.  However, more financial data is crucial for a confident long-term decision.
