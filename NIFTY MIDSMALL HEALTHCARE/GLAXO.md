Shareholding patterns remain consistent over the past year, with promoters holding a significant 75% stake.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The CM Annual Volatility of 36.68% further confirms this.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards risk due to the consistent losses and high volatility.  Further analysis using standard deviation and beta would provide a more precise risk assessment.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent promoter holding suggests confidence in the company's long-term prospects.
* History of dividend payments.
* Operates in a growing healthcare sector.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility.
* Consistent losses over the past five quarters.
* Lack of key financial ratios for a complete assessment.
* Dependence on the overall performance of the pharmaceutical sector.

**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The current price momentum is negative, volatility is high, and there are no immediate positive short-term triggers.
* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock).**  The medium-term outlook depends on improvement in financial performance and sector trends.  Further monitoring is necessary.
* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold (if you have stock).**  Long-term prospects depend on the company's ability to improve its financial performance and maintain its market position within the growing healthcare sector.  However, given the current financial performance, a long-term hold is conditional on future improvements.

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the analysis of the provided data, GLAXO presents a mixed picture. While the company benefits from a strong promoter holding and a history of dividend payments, its recent financial performance is concerning.  The high volatility adds to the risk.  Therefore, a "Don't Buy" recommendation is given for the short term.  For medium and long-term horizons, a "Hold" recommendation is given, contingent upon future improvements in financial performance and a more thorough risk assessment using complete financial statements and additional market data.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the consistent losses is crucial before making any investment decisions.
