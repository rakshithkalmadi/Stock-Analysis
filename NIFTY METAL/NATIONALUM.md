Promoter and public shareholding remains consistent over the observed period.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant week-high and week-low price differences.  The CM Daily and Annual Volatility (2.86% and 54.64% respectively) further confirm this.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards risk due to the consistent losses and high volatility.  Further analysis using standard deviation and beta would provide a more precise risk assessment.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Relatively stable promoter holding.
* Potential for turnaround if operational issues are addressed.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks**

* Consistent net losses over the past five quarters.
* High stock price volatility.
* Negative EPS.
* Lack of key financial ratios for a complete assessment.
* Limited market depth data.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and negative financial performance make a short-term investment highly risky.  The current price momentum is downward.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock).**  A medium-term outlook requires monitoring the company's efforts to address its operational challenges and improve profitability.  The upcoming corporate actions (dividends) might offer some support, but the overall financial picture needs significant improvement.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  The fundamental financial health of the company needs substantial improvement before considering a long-term investment.  While the consistent dividend payouts are positive, the negative EPS and overall losses outweigh this advantage.
