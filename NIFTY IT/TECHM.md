**Key Financial Ratios:**  Further analysis requires more detailed financial statements to calculate key ratios like Return on Equity (ROE), Debt-to-Equity ratio, and Profit Margin.  The provided data only allows for a limited assessment of financial health.

**4. Corporate Actions and Announcements:**

Tech Mahindra has a history of consistent dividend payouts, including interim and annual dividends, and special dividends in some years.  Recent announcements include several acquisitions and a board meeting to discuss interim dividends.  The frequency of announcements suggests an active management team.  However, the nature of the acquisitions and their impact on future performance needs further investigation.

Promoter holding has shown a slight downward trend over the past year, while public holding has increased correspondingly. This is a relatively minor change and doesn't indicate a significant shift in control.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits significant volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The CM Annual Volatility of 30.76% further confirms this.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards higher risk due to the recent price drop and volatility.  Further analysis using standard deviation and beta would provide a more comprehensive risk assessment.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Consistent dividend payouts.
* Strong presence in a growing IT sector.
* Active corporate actions suggesting a dynamic management.
* High delivery percentage indicating genuine buying interest.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and significant price swings.
* Recent price decline indicating negative market sentiment.
* Sector PE is relatively high, suggesting potential overvaluation.
* Declining growth rate in revenue and expenditure.
* Requires further investigation into the nature and impact of recent acquisitions.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price drop and high volatility make a short-term buy risky.  Monitoring price action and news related to recent acquisitions is crucial.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold.**  The medium-term outlook depends on the success of recent acquisitions and the overall performance of the IT sector.  Consistent dividend payouts offer some downside protection.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Hold.**  Tech Mahindra's fundamentals are relatively strong, and its position in the IT sector is promising.  However, long-term investors should carefully monitor financial performance and sector trends.
