* Recent corporate actions include a final dividend and a stock split, which are generally positive for investors.  The consistent history of dividend payments suggests a commitment to shareholder returns.


**2.5 Volatility and Risk:**

* The company's daily and annual volatility metrics are not explicitly provided in the easily accessible data.  However, the significant difference between the week's high and low price indicates considerable price volatility and therefore risk.  Further analysis of historical data would be needed to quantify this risk more precisely.

* **Chairperson & MD:** Anand Deshapde
* **CEO:** Sandeep Kalra

**3. Final Verdict:**

Based on the provided data, the recommendation is **Hold**.

**Reasoning:**

* While the company shows a history of dividend payments and generally stable revenue, the recent price drop and high volatility raise concerns.  The significant drop in EPS from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  The slight decrease in promoter holdings is also a minor negative signal.  More information is needed to assess the long-term prospects and the reasons behind the recent price volatility before recommending a buy.  The current data does not provide sufficient evidence to justify a sell recommendation.

**Conclusion:**

Persistent Systems Limited shows some positive indicators, such as consistent dividend payments and relatively stable revenue. However, the recent price drop, high volatility, and the need for further investigation into the EPS fluctuation warrant a cautious "Hold" recommendation.  A more comprehensive analysis, including a deeper dive into the financial statements and an assessment of the company's future growth prospects, is recommended before making a definitive investment decision.
