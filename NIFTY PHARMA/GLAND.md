|--------------|---------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|-------|
| 30-Sep-2023  | 57.86%                     | 42.14% | 0.00%                        | 100.00%|

**Analysis:** A significant decrease in promoter holding from approximately 58% to 51.83% between March 2024 and September 2024 is observed. This warrants further investigation into the reasons behind this reduction.


**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock price has shown significant volatility over the past year, with a week high of ₹2,220.95 and a week low of ₹1,585.70. The CM Annual Volatility of 43.18% further confirms this high volatility.  The risk-reward profile is currently high risk due to this volatility and the incomplete market depth data.


**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Relatively strong financial performance (though requiring more detailed ratio analysis).
* Dividend payout.
* Position in a growing pharmaceutical sector.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High price volatility.
* Significant decrease in promoter holding.
* Incomplete and unreliable market depth data.
* Lack of detailed financial ratio analysis due to incomplete data.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Hold.** The recent price action and high volatility make a short-term buy risky.  Holding is recommended until more clarity emerges regarding the promoter shareholding reduction and market depth.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Don't Buy.** The decrease in promoter holding raises concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind this and the potential impact on the company's future performance.  The high volatility also adds to the risk.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  While the pharmaceutical sector offers long-term growth potential, the current uncertainties surrounding Gland Pharma, particularly the promoter shareholding change, make a long-term investment inadvisable without further investigation.
