**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits significant volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The CM Annual Volatility of 37.25% further confirms this.  The risk-reward profile is currently skewed towards higher risk due to the price fluctuations and the uncertain financial performance trends.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* **Dividend payouts:**  Consistent interim dividend payments indicate a commitment to shareholder returns.
* **Established company:** Listing since 2016 suggests a degree of market stability and acceptance.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* **High Volatility:**  Significant price swings pose substantial risk to short-term investors.
* **Declining EPS:**  Recent decline in EPS raises concerns about profitability.

* **Limited Market Depth Data:**  Lack of sufficient data hinders a complete risk assessment.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The recent price decline and high volatility make short-term investment risky.  The lack of strong short-term catalysts further supports this recommendation.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock).**  The medium-term outlook depends on the company's ability to improve its financial performance and stabilize its price.  Monitoring upcoming corporate actions and financial results is crucial.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Hold (if you have stock).**  Long-term investors should carefully consider the company's fundamentals, future growth prospects within the pharmaceutical sector, and the overall market conditions.  The high P/E ratio warrants caution.
