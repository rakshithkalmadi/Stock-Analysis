**Hold.**

While the financial performance shows a generally positive trend with consistent profitability and dividend payouts, the recent price drop and relatively high annual volatility warrant a cautious approach.  The consistent promoter holding is a positive sign, but further observation is needed to assess the sustainability of the recent downward trend.  The high delivery percentage suggests some level of confidence in the stock.  More data is needed to determine if the recent price drop is a temporary correction or the start of a longer-term decline.  A "Hold" recommendation allows for further monitoring before making a buy or sell decision.

**Conclusion:**

Ajanta Pharma shows signs of financial health with consistent profitability and shareholder returns. However, recent price action and volatility suggest a need for caution.  Further observation is recommended before a definitive buy or sell decision.
