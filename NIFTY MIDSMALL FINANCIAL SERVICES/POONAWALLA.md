|-----------------|---------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|-------|
| 30-Sep-2023     | 62.10%                     | 37.90% | 0.00%                         | 100.00%|

Promoter holding remains relatively stable, though a slight decrease is observed in the latest quarter.  The increase in employee trust shareholding is minimal.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant difference between the week high (519.7) and week low (270.05).  The low market depth further amplifies the risk.  The high volatility and low liquidity create a high-risk, high-reward profile.  Further quantitative risk assessment using standard deviation and beta would be beneficial.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Relatively high promoter holding suggests some degree of management confidence.
* History of dividend payments.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility and significant price swings.
* Inconsistent financial performance (profits and losses in recent quarters).
* Extremely low market depth, indicating low liquidity and potential for large price swings on even small trades.
* Missing key financial ratios prevent a thorough fundamental analysis.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and low liquidity make short-term trading extremely risky.  The recent negative price movement further strengthens this recommendation.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy.**  The medium-term outlook depends heavily on improved financial performance and increased market depth.  Without significant improvements, the risk remains high.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  While the promoter holding is a positive, the inconsistent financial performance and lack of crucial financial data make a long-term investment too risky without further investigation.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10): 4.5**

* Financial health: 3/10 (Inconsistent profitability, missing key ratios)
* Market performance: 4/10 (High volatility, negative recent trend)
* Volatility and risk: 2/10 (High volatility, extremely low liquidity)
* Corporate actions and governance: 6/10 (Active corporate actions, relatively stable promoter holding)
* Shareholding patterns: 5/10 (Stable promoter holding, minimal employee trust holding)

**Analysis Score (out of 10): 7**

* Completeness and utilization of data: 8/10 (Most data used effectively)
* Accuracy and clarity of analysis: 7/10 (Analysis is clear but limited by missing data)
* Professional formatting: 7/10 (Report is well-structured and easy to read)


**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the analysis of the provided data, POONAWALLA presents a high-risk investment.  The high volatility, low liquidity, and inconsistent financial performance outweigh the positive aspects of relatively stable promoter holding and a history of dividend payments.  Therefore, a "Don't Buy" recommendation is given for both short-term and long-term investment horizons.  A "Hold" recommendation is given for medium-term only if the investor already holds the stock, pending significant improvements in market depth and financial performance.  Further research is strongly recommended before considering any investment in this stock.  Specifically, obtaining and analyzing missing financial ratios and a deeper understanding of the company's competitive positioning within the NBFC sector are crucial.
