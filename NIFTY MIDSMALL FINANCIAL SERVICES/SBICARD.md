|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|
| Q1 2024 (Jan-Mar) | 447.46              | 358.64                 | -66.24                             | -6.97   |

**Key Financial Ratios:**  Further analysis of key financial ratios (e.g., Return on Equity, Debt-to-Equity ratio) is needed for a complete assessment.  The provided data does not contain this information.  The consistently negative profit after tax is a major red flag.


**4. Corporate Actions and Announcements:**

* **Dividends:** SBICARD has declared interim dividends in the past, most recently ₹2.50 per share with an ex-date of March 28, 2024.
* **Announcements:** Recent announcements include updates on litigation, press releases, general updates, and analyst meetings.  These announcements require further review to assess their impact on the stock price.  The announcement regarding raising funds through NCDs is a positive sign, but the details need further investigation.


**5. Shareholding Patterns:**

| Quarter      | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------|-----------|
| 30-Sep-2023  | 68.94                       | 31.06      | 0.00               | 100.00    |
| 31-Dec-2023  | 68.75                       | 31.25      | 0.00               | 100.00    |
| 31-Mar-2024  | 68.63                       | 31.37      | 0.00               | 100.00    |
| 30-Jun-2024  | 68.62                       | 31.38      | 0.00               | 100.00    |
| 30-Sep-2024  | 68.61                       | 31.39      | 0.00               | 100.00    |

Promoter holding has slightly decreased over the past year, while public holding has correspondingly increased. This is a relatively minor change and doesn't significantly alter the overall shareholding structure.


**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits significant volatility, as evidenced by the week's high and low prices.  The low market depth further amplifies this risk.  The consistently negative profit after tax significantly increases the risk profile.  A more detailed analysis using historical price data and statistical measures (e.g., beta, standard deviation) is needed for a comprehensive risk assessment.


**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Strong brand association with SBI.
* Potential for growth in the credit card market.
* Recent announcement of raising funds through NCDs could improve the financial position.


**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* Consistently negative profit after tax over the last five quarters.
* High volatility and low market depth.
* Intense competition in the credit card industry.
* Dependence on the Indian economy's performance.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The current negative price momentum, high volatility, and low market depth make a short-term investment highly risky.  The negative profit after tax is a major concern.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  The medium-term outlook depends heavily on the company's ability to improve its financial performance.  The NCD issuance could be a positive factor, but further monitoring is crucial.  The risk remains high.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  The fundamental weakness (consistently negative profit after tax) outweighs the long-term potential.  Significant improvement in financial performance is needed before considering a long-term investment.


**10. Stock and Analysis Scoring:**

**Stock Score (out of 10): 4/10**

* Financial Health: 2/10 (Consistently negative profit after tax is a major drawback)
* Market Performance: 3/10 (Moderate volatility, negative recent price movement)
* Volatility and Risk: 2/10 (High volatility, low market depth)
* Corporate Actions & Governance: 5/10 (Dividend history is positive, but other announcements need further review)
* Shareholding Patterns: 7/10 (Stable shareholding pattern)

**Analysis Score (out of 10): 8/10**

* Completeness and Utilization of Data: 9/10 (Most data points were used effectively)
* Accuracy and Clarity of Analysis: 8/10 (Analysis is clear, but some aspects require more in-depth investigation)
* Professional Formatting: 9/10 (Report is well-structured and easy to read)


**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the analysis of available data, SBICARD presents a high-risk investment.  The consistently negative profit after tax is a significant concern that overshadows the positive aspects like the SBI brand association and the recent NCD announcement.  Therefore, a "Don't Buy" recommendation is given for both short-term and long-term horizons.  A "Hold" recommendation is given for medium-term only if the investor already holds the stock, but a new investment is not advised.  Further investigation into the company's financial statements and industry dynamics is recommended before making any investment decision.
