|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Q1 2024      | 143,369     | -7,339      | 95,354                | 42.44   |

**Key Financial Ratios:**  These ratios cannot be calculated accurately due to the inconsistent and sometimes negative profit figures.  Further investigation is needed to obtain a complete financial picture.

**4. Corporate Actions and Announcements:**

PEL has a history of dividend payouts and has undertaken a buyback and demerger in the past.  A recent dividend of ₹10 per share was announced with an ex-date of July 5, 2024.  Numerous announcements regarding loss or duplicate share certificates suggest potential administrative issues.  The "Updates" subject in recent announcements requires further investigation to determine their impact on the stock price.

**5. Shareholding Patterns:**

| Quarter      | Promoter & Promoter Group (%) | Public (%) | Shares held by Employee Trusts (%) | Total (%) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| 30-Sep-2023  | 46.19                        | 53.31      | 0.50                             | 100.00    |
| 31-Dec-2023  | 46.19                        | 53.31      | 0.50                             | 100.00    |
| 31-Mar-2024  | 46.19                        | 53.31      | 0.49                             | 100.00    |
| 30-Jun-2024  | 46.03                        | 53.48      | 0.50                             | 100.00    |
| 30-Sep-2024  | 46.30                        | 53.29      | 0.41                             | 100.00    |

Promoter shareholding remains relatively stable, indicating confidence in the company's long-term prospects. However, the reasons behind the minor fluctuations need further investigation.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the significant week-high and week-low prices. The reported annual volatility of 45.66% further confirms this.  The inconsistent financial performance adds to the risk.  The risk-reward profile is currently unfavorable due to the high volatility and recent losses.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* Relatively stable promoter holding.
* History of dividend payouts.
* Established presence in the NBFC sector.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* High volatility.
* Inconsistent and declining financial performance in recent quarters.
* Incomplete and concerning market depth data.
* Zero reported Symbol PE ratio requires further investigation.
* Numerous announcements regarding lost share certificates suggest potential administrative weaknesses.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and recent negative price momentum make a short-term investment risky.  The incomplete market depth data further increases uncertainty.

* **Medium-term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock).**  A medium-term outlook requires a clearer understanding of the reasons behind the recent financial losses.  Further investigation into the "Updates" announcements is crucial.  If the underlying issues are addressed and financial performance improves, a positive outlook might be warranted.  Otherwise, consider selling.

* **Long-term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  While the promoter holding is stable, the inconsistent financial performance and high volatility present significant long-term risks.  A more thorough fundamental analysis is needed before considering a long-term investment.

* Financial Health: 2/10 (Inconsistent and declining profitability)

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

Based on the available data, PEL presents a high-risk investment.  The inconsistent financial performance, high volatility, and incomplete market data make it unsuitable for short-term or long-term investment at this time.  If you currently hold PEL stock, a medium-term "Hold" is recommended, contingent upon further investigation into the company's recent financial performance and announcements.
