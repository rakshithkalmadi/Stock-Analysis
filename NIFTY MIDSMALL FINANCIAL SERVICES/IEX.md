There are no significant changes in shareholding patterns over the past year.  The lack of promoter holding is noteworthy and warrants further investigation into the company's ownership structure.

**6. Volatility and Risk Assessment:**

The week's high and low prices (₹244.40 and ₹130.20 respectively) indicate significant price volatility. The annualized volatility (44.32%) further confirms this high-risk profile.  The low market depth adds to the risk, as it may be difficult to buy or sell large quantities of shares without significantly impacting the price.

**7. Advantages of Buying the Stock:**

* **Sector Positioning:** IEX operates in a growing sector with potential for long-term growth in India's energy market.
* **Dividend History:**  The company has a history of paying dividends, providing some income potential for investors.

**8. Disadvantages and Risks:**

* **High Volatility:** The stock exhibits significant price swings, posing substantial risk to short-term investors.
* **Negative Profitability:**  Consistent losses raise concerns about the company's long-term financial sustainability.
* **Low Market Depth:** Limited liquidity increases the risk of price slippage when buying or selling.
* **Low Promoter Holding:** The absence of significant promoter holding raises governance concerns.


**9. Investment Horizon Recommendations:**

* **Short-Term (less than 3 months): Don't Buy.** The high volatility and recent negative price movement make a short-term investment highly risky.  The low market depth further exacerbates this risk.

* **Medium-Term (3 to 12 months): Hold (if you have stock), Don't Buy (if you don't).**  While the sector has long-term potential, the company's current financial performance is concerning.  Further investigation into the reasons for the losses is crucial before considering a new investment.  If you already hold the stock, a "hold" strategy might be considered, but closely monitor the financial performance and market conditions.

* **Long-Term (1 year and beyond): Don't Buy.**  The consistent losses and lack of promoter holding outweigh the potential long-term growth of the sector.  The risks associated with this stock are too high for a long-term investment at this time.

**11. Professional Recommendation Summary:**

The high volatility, negative profitability, low market depth, and lack of promoter holding present significant risks that outweigh the potential benefits.
