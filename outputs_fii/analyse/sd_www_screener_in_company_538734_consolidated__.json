**Note:**  This JSON object represents a structured version of the extracted data.  Many numerical values are presented as text within the original HTML.  A robust data extraction process would require parsing HTML tables and converting textual representations of numbers into numerical data types for further analysis and calculations.  The `null` values indicate data points that are not explicitly present but could be derived from the provided data with further processing.  The "Note" fields highlight sections requiring further processing of the HTML tables.
