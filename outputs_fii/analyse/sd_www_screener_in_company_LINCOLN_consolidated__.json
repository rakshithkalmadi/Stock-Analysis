**Note:**  This JSON represents a structured extraction of the provided HTML.  Many numerical values are presented as strings because their exact format (e.g., number of decimal places, currency symbols) needs to be preserved for accurate representation.  Complete data extraction from the tables (Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Ratios, Peer Comparison) requires more sophisticated HTML parsing and potentially table recognition capabilities beyond the scope of a simple JSON response.  The "Other Insights" section includes important disclaimers and notes from the original HTML.  Finally, calculations for ratios not explicitly provided (e.g., Debt-to-Equity) would require further processing of the extracted financial data.
