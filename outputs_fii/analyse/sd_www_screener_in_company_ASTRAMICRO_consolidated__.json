**Note:**  This JSON represents a significant portion of the extractable data.  However, several tables within the HTML (Quarterly Results, Profit & Loss (Annual), Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Ratios, Shareholding Pattern) contain extensive numerical data that requires further parsing and structuring to be fully included.  The `Note` fields within the JSON indicate where this additional parsing is needed.  A robust HTML parsing library would be necessary to fully automate this process.
