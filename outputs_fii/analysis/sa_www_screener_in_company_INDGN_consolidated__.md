The high EPS in 2019 and 2020 appears anomalous and requires further investigation.  The lack of a tax percentage for the most recent year hinders a complete analysis.

**Cash Flow:**  The available cash flow data is incomplete, preventing a thorough assessment of cash flow generation and management.

**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Indegene's P/E ratio (37.9) is higher than the median P/E of its peers (41.99). However, its ROCE (29.0%) is significantly higher than the median (14.74%).  This suggests that while the stock might appear overvalued based on P/E, its superior profitability could justify a higher valuation.  A more detailed peer comparison requires a more complete dataset.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

The high P/E ratio and the lack of complete data make a definitive valuation challenging.  While the strong ROCE and ROE suggest a healthy business, the high P/E ratio indicates a premium valuation.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the current price reflects future growth potential.  The P/B ratio of 5.97 is also high, suggesting potential overvaluation.


**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

Given the incomplete data and the high P/E ratio, assigning high confidence levels to any recommendation is premature.  Further investigation is required to address the data gaps and anomalies.

**Short-term (3-6 months):**  Neutral.  Confidence Level: Low.  Reasoning:  The market's reaction to the next quarterly results and any further information will be crucial.

**Medium-term (6-12 months):**  Neutral to cautiously optimistic. Confidence Level: Low. Reasoning:  Pending further analysis to clarify the anomalies in the financial statements and to obtain a more complete picture of the company's financial health and growth prospects.

**Long-term (1+ years):**  Potentially positive, but requires further due diligence. Confidence Level: Low. Reasoning:  The company's strong ROCE and historical growth are positive indicators, but the high valuation and data gaps need to be addressed before a confident long-term outlook can be provided.


**9. Final Verdict:**

Indegene Ltd shows promising growth potential based on its historical performance and high ROCE. However, the high P/E ratio and significant data gaps prevent a definitive conclusion on its valuation and future prospects.  A more thorough analysis, including obtaining missing financial data, investigating the anomalies in the annual results, and performing a more detailed peer comparison, is necessary before making informed investment decisions.  The current data suggests a need for caution, and a wait-and-see approach is recommended until more information becomes available.
