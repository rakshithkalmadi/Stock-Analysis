* **Annual Results:** Sales and net profit have shown strong growth in the past, but growth has slowed in FY24.  EPS growth has also slowed.

* **Cash Flow Trends:** Cash flow from operating activities has improved significantly in FY24, but cash flow from investing activities remains negative, indicating significant capital expenditures.  Net cash flow is positive but volatile.

**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Epack Durable's P/E ratio (93.1) is higher than the median P/E of its peers (97.28).  Its market capitalization is significantly lower.  Its ROCE (8.32%) is comparable to the median (8.41%), but its ROE is lower.  The company's quarterly sales and profit variability is also higher than its peers.  Voltas and Blue Star appear to be significantly more profitable and stable.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

The high P/E ratio (93.1) and P/B ratio (4.87) suggest that Epack Durable is potentially overvalued compared to its peers and its own historical performance.  While the company has shown strong growth in the past, the recent slowdown in growth and the low ROE raise concerns.  The lack of dividend payouts further contributes to the overvaluation concern.


**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

* **Short-term (3-6 months):** Hold.  The high valuation and volatile quarterly results make a buy recommendation risky in the short term.  (Confidence Level: Medium)
* **Medium-term (6-12 months):** Hold or cautiously consider selling if the valuation doesn't improve and growth doesn't reaccelerate.  The company needs to demonstrate sustained profitability and improved operational efficiency. (Confidence Level: Medium)
* **Long-term (1+ years):**  Hold with caution.  The company's market position is a strength, but its high valuation and operational challenges need to be addressed.  Long-term success depends on improving profitability, managing debt, and demonstrating consistent growth. (Confidence Level: Medium)


**9. Final Verdict:**

Epack Durable Ltd. presents a mixed picture.  Its strong market position and past growth are positive factors. However, the high valuation, low ROE, fluctuating profitability, and increasing working capital days raise significant concerns.  Investors should proceed with caution, closely monitoring the company's financial performance and operational efficiency before making any significant investment decisions.  Further analysis, including a detailed debt-to-equity ratio calculation and a deeper dive into the reasons behind the fluctuating profitability and working capital, is recommended before making a definitive investment decision.  The current high valuation makes it a risky investment unless the company can demonstrate a clear path to improved profitability and sustained growth.
