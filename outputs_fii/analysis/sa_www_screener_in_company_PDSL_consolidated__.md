PDS Ltd.'s P/E ratio (54.4) is significantly higher than the median P/E of its peers (37.07).  Its ROCE (17.5%) is higher than the median (9.64%), but the other metrics require more complete data for a meaningful comparison.  The market capitalization is significantly smaller than its peers.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

Due to the significant data gaps, the confidence levels for these recommendations are low.  Further analysis with complete financial data is crucial.

* **Short-term (3-6 months):** Hold or cautiously sell.  (Confidence Level: Low)  The negative TTM profit growth and high valuation metrics warrant caution.
* **Medium-term (6-12 months):** Hold. (Confidence Level: Low)  Further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of the business model and the reasons behind the negative profit growth.
* **Long-term (1+ years):**  Neutral. (Confidence Level: Low)  Long-term prospects depend on the company's ability to address the issues highlighted in this analysis.


**9. Final Verdict:**

PDS Ltd. presents a mixed picture. While historical growth has been positive, the recent negative profit growth and high valuation metrics raise significant concerns.  The incomplete financial data severely limits the ability to provide a definitive assessment.  Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence, including obtaining and analyzing complete financial statements, before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests a high risk profile.  A more comprehensive analysis with complete data is required to improve the confidence level of any recommendations.
