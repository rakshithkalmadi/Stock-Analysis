## Astra Microwave Products Ltd. - Financial Analysis

This analysis utilizes the provided JSON data and acknowledges the limitations imposed by the absence of fully parsed tabular data from the associated HTML.  Therefore, certain aspects of the analysis will be less precise than a complete data set would allow.

**1. Company Overview:**

Astra Microwave Products Ltd. operates in the Aerospace & Defence sector, specifically within the Telecommunications - Equipment industry.  Its business model centers on the design, development, and manufacture of radio frequency and microwave sub-systems for defense, space, meteorology, and telecommunication applications.  The company holds a position within various Indian stock market indices (BSE SmallCap, BSE Allcap, etc.), indicating its presence in the broader market, though it's categorized as a small-cap stock.  A recent large order (₹255.88 crores) from the Ministry of Defence highlights a significant achievement.

**2. Key Financial Metrics:**

* **Market Cap:** ₹7,570 Cr.
* **Current Price:** ₹797
* **High/Low (52-week):** ₹1,060 / ₹510
* **P/E Ratio:** 58.1
* **Book Value:** ₹103
* **Dividend Yield:** 0.25%
* **ROCE:** 18.8%
* **ROE:** 15.0%
* **Face Value:** ₹2.00

**3. Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

* **Strong recent profit growth:**  The 105% CAGR in profit over the last 5 years is a significant strength.
* **High ROCE:**  An 18.8% ROCE suggests efficient capital utilization.
* **Large order from Ministry of Defence:** This indicates strong potential for future revenue.

**Weaknesses:**

* **High P/E Ratio:** A P/E of 58.1 suggests the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers or the market average (further analysis needed with industry benchmarks).
* **Low Promoter Holding:**  6.54% promoter holding raises concerns about corporate governance and potential for short-term price volatility.
* **High Debtor Days (unquantified):**  The note indicates high debtor days, suggesting potential cash flow issues.  Precise data is needed for a proper assessment.
* **Low Return on Equity (historical):** While current ROE is 15%, the historical data shows lower ROE (11% over 3 years), indicating potential variability in profitability.


**4. Performance Trends:**

Detailed analysis is impossible without the parsed data from the HTML tables.  However, the available growth ratios suggest strong recent growth in sales and profits, but a more in-depth look at quarterly and annual results, balance sheet health, and cash flow trends is crucial for a complete picture.

**5. Growth Metrics:**

* **Sales CAGR (10Y/5Y/3Y/TTM):** 6%/25%/12%/21%
* **Profit CAGR (10Y/5Y/3Y/TTM):** 9%/105%/61%/102%
* **Stock Price CAGR (10Y/5Y/3Y/1Y):** 22%/57%/52%/31%
* **ROE (10Y/5Y/3Y/TTM):** 11%/10%/11%/15%

The growth metrics show impressive growth in sales and profits, particularly over the last 5 years.  Stock price growth has also been substantial.  However, the variability in ROE needs further investigation.

**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Comparing Astra Microwave to its peers (ITI and Avantel) reveals a mixed picture.  Astra Microwave has a significantly lower P/E ratio than ITI, but a slightly higher P/E than Avantel.  Avantel shows a much higher ROCE.  A more detailed comparison requires a deeper analysis of financial statements and industry averages.

**7. Stock Valuation:**

The high P/E ratio (58.1) and the lack of Price-to-Book and other valuation ratios (due to missing data) make a definitive valuation judgment difficult.  The high growth rates suggest potential justification for a higher P/E, but the low promoter holding and high debtor days introduce significant risk.  Further analysis with complete data is needed.

**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

Due to the incomplete data, assigning precise recommendations with high confidence is not possible.  However, a preliminary assessment can be made:

* **Short-term (3-6 months):** Neutral.  The high P/E ratio and low promoter holding suggest caution.  (Confidence Level: Low)
* **Medium-term (6-12 months):**  Potentially positive, contingent on further analysis of the missing financial data and confirmation of the sustainability of recent growth. (Confidence Level: Low)
* **Long-term (1+ years):**  Potentially positive, if the company can maintain its growth trajectory and improve corporate governance.  (Confidence Level: Low)

**9. Final Verdict:**

Astra Microwave Products Ltd. shows signs of strong recent growth, particularly in profitability.  However, several red flags exist, including a high P/E ratio, low promoter holding, and potentially high debtor days.  The incomplete financial data significantly limits the ability to make a confident assessment.  A thorough analysis of the missing data from the HTML tables is absolutely necessary before making any investment decisions.  The current analysis provides a preliminary overview, but should not be considered a basis for investment decisions without further investigation.
