## Shivalik Rasayan Ltd: Comprehensive Financial Analysis

**1. Company Overview:**

Shivalik Rasayan Ltd (SRL) is an Indian agrochemical company established in 1979.  Its business model centers around the manufacturing of agrochemicals, primarily organophosphorus-based insecticides and chemicals, and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs).  SRL holds a strong market position as the largest Indian producer of Dimethoate Technical and the second largest producer of Malathion Technical.  While the company also engages in API development for oncology and non-oncology applications, the agrochemical segment appears to be its core business and primary revenue driver.


**2. Key Financial Metrics:**

* **Current Price:** ₹784
* **P/E Ratio:** 87.0 (High, indicating potential overvaluation)
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** 2.74% (Low, suggesting inefficient use of shareholder equity)
* **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** 6.08% (Low, indicating suboptimal capital utilization)
* **Dividend Yield:** 0.06% (Very low, minimal dividend payout)
* **Market Capitalization:** ₹1,220 Cr.
* **Book Value:** ₹326 (Price-to-Book ratio is approximately 2.4, suggesting potential overvaluation)


**3. Strengths and Weaknesses:**

**Strengths:**

* Strong market position in specific agrochemical segments.
* Diversification into API manufacturing, offering potential for future growth.

**Weaknesses:**

* Extremely high P/E ratio compared to peers, suggesting potential overvaluation.
* Low ROE and ROCE indicate poor profitability and capital efficiency.
* Low dividend yield offers limited returns to investors.
* Significant decline in ROCE over the years (from 32% to 6%), indicating deteriorating operational efficiency.
* Significant decline in promoter holding over the past 3 years (-4.97%), raising concerns about management confidence.
* High volatility in quarterly results, indicating inconsistent performance.
* Increasing inventory days and cash conversion cycle, suggesting potential issues with inventory management and receivables collection.


**4. Performance Trends:**

* **Quarterly Results:**  Show significant volatility in sales, operating profit, and net profit. OPM% is also inconsistent, fluctuating between 12% and 21%.  The data suggests a lack of consistent operational efficiency.
* **Profit and Loss Trends:**  While sales growth has been positive in recent years (19% TTM), profit growth has been negative or stagnant (-1% TTM, -10% over 3 years). This divergence highlights issues with cost control and profitability.
* **Balance Sheet Health:**  The provided data doesn't directly assess balance sheet health, but the high inventory days and increasing cash conversion cycle raise concerns about working capital management.
* **Cash Flow Trends:**  Not directly provided in the data.
* **Financial Ratios:**  The declining ROCE and low ROE are significant red flags.  The increasing cash conversion cycle and working capital days indicate operational inefficiencies.


**5. Growth Metrics:**

* **Sales CAGR (5 years):** 9.86% (Moderate)
* **Profit CAGR (5 years):** -1% (Negative)
* **Stock Price CAGR (5 years):** 25% (High, but potentially unsustainable given the financial performance)
* **ROE:**  The provided data shows a declining trend in ROE: 6% (5 years), 6% (3 years), 3% (Last Year). This is a major concern.


**6. Comparison to Benchmarks:**

Compared to its peers, Shivalik Rasayan has a significantly higher P/E ratio (87.0) than the median (32.8).  Its ROCE (6.08%) is also considerably lower than the median (11.14%).  This comparison strongly suggests that SRL is overvalued relative to its peers.  The significantly lower market capitalization also indicates a smaller scale of operations compared to its competitors.


**7. Stock Valuation:**

Based on the high P/E ratio, low ROE, low ROCE, and the comparison to peers, Shivalik Rasayan appears significantly overvalued. The Price-to-Book ratio of approximately 2.4 further supports this conclusion.  The company's growth prospects, while showing some positive sales growth, are overshadowed by its poor profitability and operational efficiency.


**8. Recommendations and Confidence Levels:**

* **Short-term (3-6 months):** **Sell/Avoid**.  The high valuation and weak fundamentals make a short-term price increase unlikely.  **Confidence Level: High**
* **Medium-term (6-12 months):** **Sell/Avoid**.  Unless significant improvements in operational efficiency and profitability are demonstrated, the overvaluation is likely to persist. **Confidence Level: High**
* **Long-term (1+ years):** **Hold (only if significant improvements are observed)**.  The company's diversification into APIs offers some long-term potential, but this is contingent upon substantial improvements in its core agrochemical business.  **Confidence Level: Medium** (This is conditional and depends on future performance improvements).


**9. Final Verdict:**

Shivalik Rasayan Ltd presents a high-risk investment.  The company's current valuation is not justified by its financial performance.  The low ROE, ROCE, and high P/E ratio, coupled with inconsistent quarterly results and declining operational efficiency, indicate significant weaknesses. While the diversification into APIs offers some long-term potential, the immediate outlook is negative.  Investors should exercise extreme caution and only consider a long-term hold if the company demonstrates substantial improvements in profitability and operational efficiency.  A sell or avoid strategy is recommended in the short to medium term.
